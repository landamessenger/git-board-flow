/**
 * Single action run after a successful deployment (triggered with the "deployed" action and an issue number).
 *
 * Requires the issue to have the "deploy" label and not already have the "deployed" label. Then:
 * 1. Replaces the "deploy" label with "deployed".
 * 2. If a release or hotfix branch is configured: merges it into default and develop (each via PR, waiting for that PR's checks).
 * 3. Closes the issue only when all merges succeed.
 *
 * @see docs/single-actions/deploy-label-and-merge.mdx for the full flow and how merge/check waiting works.
