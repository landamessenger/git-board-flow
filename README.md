## Commit Prefix Transforms

Git Board Flow allows you to customize how branch names are transformed into commit prefixes using the `commit-prefix-transforms` parameter. You can apply multiple transformations sequentially to achieve the desired format.

### Available Transformations

| Transform | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `replace-slash` | Replace "/" with "-" | `feature/user-auth` → `feature-user-auth` |
| `replace-all` | Replace all special chars with "-" | `feature/user_auth!` → `feature-user-auth-` |
| `lowercase` | Convert to lowercase | `Feature/User-Auth` → `feature/user-auth` |
| `uppercase` | Convert to uppercase | `feature/user-auth` → `FEATURE/USER-AUTH` |
| `kebab-case` | Clean kebab-case format | `Feature/User_Auth` → `feature-user-auth` |
| `snake-case` | Convert to snake_case | `feature/user-auth` → `feature_user_auth` |
| `camel-case` | Convert to camelCase | `feature/user-auth` → `featureUserAuth` |
| `trim` | Remove leading/trailing spaces | ` feature/user-auth ` → `feature/user-auth` |
| `remove-numbers` | Remove all numbers | `feature/123-user-auth` → `feature/-user-auth` |
| `remove-special` | Remove all special characters | `feature/user-auth!` → `featureuserauth` |
| `remove-spaces` | Remove all spaces | `feature/ user auth ` → `feature/userauth` |
| `remove-dashes` | Remove all dashes | `feature-user-auth` → `featureuserauth` |
| `remove-underscores` | Remove all underscores | `feature_user_auth` → `featureuserauth` |
| `clean-dashes` | Clean multiple dashes | `feature--user---auth` → `feature-user-auth` |
| `clean-underscores` | Clean multiple underscores | `feature__user___auth` → `feature_user_auth` |
| `prefix` | Add prefix | `user-auth` → `prefix-user-auth` |
| `suffix` | Add suffix | `user-auth` → `user-auth-suffix` |

### Usage Examples

#### Single Transformation
```yaml
commit-prefix-transforms: "replace-slash"
# Result: feature/user-auth → feature-user-auth
```

#### Multiple Transformations
```yaml
commit-prefix-transforms: "replace-all,lowercase,clean-dashes"
# Result: Feature/User_Auth! → feature-user-auth
```

#### Advanced Example
```yaml
commit-prefix-transforms: "replace-all,remove-numbers,clean-dashes,kebab-case"
# Result: feature/123-user-auth_v2.0 → feature-user-auth-v
```

#### Custom Workflow Examples
```yaml
# For clean commit prefixes
commit-prefix-transforms: "replace-all,kebab-case"

# For snake_case convention
commit-prefix-transforms: "replace-all,snake-case"

# For camelCase convention  
commit-prefix-transforms: "replace-all,camel-case"

# For uppercase convention
commit-prefix-transforms: "replace-all,uppercase,clean-dashes"
```

### Default Behavior
If no `commit-prefix-transforms` is specified, the default `replace-slash` transformation is applied, maintaining backward compatibility with existing configurations.

## 🤖 AI Container System

Git Board Flow includes a sophisticated AI container management system for efficient code analysis and vector indexing.

### Architecture Overview

The AI system uses Docker containers with pre-loaded machine learning models to perform semantic code analysis:

```
🐳 AI Container (6.62 GB)
├── 🐍 Python 3.11-slim (base)
├── 🤖 InstructorEmbedding model (~4 GB)
├── 📦 Python dependencies (~2 GB)
├── 🚀 FastAPI server
└── 🔧 System tools
```

### Container Naming Convention

AI containers follow a standardized naming pattern:
```
{organization_name}-manager-ai:latest
```

Examples:
- `git-board-flow-manager-ai:latest`
- `mycompany-manager-ai:latest`
- `opensource-project-manager-ai:latest`

### Environment-Specific Behavior

#### 🏠 **Local Development & Self-hosted Runners**
- **Strategy**: Use local images (persistent)
- **Behavior**: 
  - If image exists locally → Use it directly
  - If image doesn't exist → Build locally
  - Automatic cleanup of dangling images
- **Benefits**: Fast execution, no network overhead

#### ☁️ **GitHub-hosted Runners**
- **Strategy**: Use pre-built images from registry
- **Behavior**:
  - Check if image exists in registry
  - If exists → Pull and use
  - If doesn't exist → Build and push to registry
- **Benefits**: Consistent environment, shared resources

### CLI Commands

#### Build AI Container
```bash
# Build container and execute vector indexing
git-board-flow build-ai

# Build container only (skip vector indexing)
git-board-flow build-ai --skip-vector

# Build with debug mode
git-board-flow build-ai --debug
```

#### Ask AI Questions
```bash
# Ask AI about specific issue
git-board-flow ask-ai --issue 123 --question "How does authentication work?"

# Ask AI about specific branch
git-board-flow ask-ai --branch feature/auth --question "What are the main components?"
```

### GitHub Actions Integration

The AI system automatically integrates with GitHub Actions workflows:

```yaml
name: AI Knowledge Update
on:
  push:
    branches: ['**']

jobs:
  update-ai:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, macOS, X64]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Update AI Knowledge
        uses: ./
        with:
          single-action: vector_action
          # ... other parameters
```

### Registry Management

#### Automatic Architecture Detection
- **macOS ARM64 (M1/M2)**: `{org}-manager-arm64-ai:latest`
- **macOS x64**: `{org}-manager-amd64-ai:latest`
- **Linux x64**: `{org}-manager-amd64-ai:latest`
- **Linux ARM64**: `{org}-manager-arm64-ai:latest`
- **Linux ARM32**: `{org}-manager-armv7-ai:latest`

#### Registry Options
- **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)**: Recommended for GitHub projects
- **Docker Hub**: Universal compatibility
- **AWS ECR**: Enterprise-grade security
- **Azure ACR**: Microsoft ecosystem integration

### Performance Optimization

#### Space Management
- **Before**: ~46 GB (multiple duplicate images)
- **After**: ~13 GB (optimized image management)
- **Savings**: ~33 GB of disk space

#### Execution Speed
- **Local/Self-hosted**: Instant (uses cached images)
- **GitHub-hosted**: Fast pull (~2-3 minutes for 6.62 GB)
- **Build time**: ~10-15 minutes (only when needed)

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

**Image not found in registry**
```bash
# Solution: Build and push image
git-board-flow build-ai --skip-vector
```

**Docker space issues**
```bash
# Solution: Clean up dangling images
docker system prune -f
```

**Permission denied**
```bash
# Solution: Login to registry
docker login ghcr.io
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Initial Setup**: Run `git-board-flow build-ai` to create initial container
2. **Code Changes**: AI automatically detects and indexes new code
3. **Registry Updates**: Push updated images when dependencies change
4. **Team Collaboration**: All team members use same pre-built images
