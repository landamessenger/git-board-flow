# Git Board Flow: Automated Branch and Project Management GitHub Action

**Git Board Flow** is a powerful GitHub Action designed to streamline issue, branch, and project management while adhering to the Git-Flow methodology. This action simplifies your workflow by automating the creation and management of branches, linking them to issues, and ensuring smooth integration with GitHub Projects.

## Key Features

### 1. **Automatic Branch Creation**
- Detects when an issue is created or updated.
- Analyzes issue labels (or configuration defined in your workflow) to determine the necessary branches:
- **Feature**, **Bugfix**, **Hotfix**, **Release**, etc., following Git-Flow standards.
- Automatically creates branches and links them to the issue.
- Adds a summary comment to the issue describing the actions taken.

### 2. **Commit Monitoring**
- Detects commits in branches linked to an issue.
- Posts updates in the issue with a summary of the commits, including:
- Commit messages.
- Branch names.
- Links to the commit history.

### 3. **Pull Request Linking**
- Detects new PRs from branches linked to an issue.
- Automatically links the PR to the corresponding issue.
- Posts a comment in the PR summarizing its linkage and actions.

### 4. **GitHub Project Integration**
- Seamlessly links issues and PRs to the specified GitHub Projects.
- Ensures that all relevant entities are included in the right projects automatically.

### 5. **Efficiency**
- Runs on **Ubuntu** and completes tasks in under **20 seconds**, making it cost-effective and efficient for any repository.

## Use Cases
- **Team Collaboration**: Keep issues, branches, and PRs connected effortlessly for better visibility.

## Commit Prefix Transforms

Git Board Flow allows you to customize how branch names are transformed into commit prefixes using the `commit-prefix-transforms` parameter. You can apply multiple transformations sequentially to achieve the desired format.

### Available Transformations

| Transform | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `replace-slash` | Replace "/" with "-" | `feature/user-auth` â†’ `feature-user-auth` |
| `replace-all` | Replace all special chars with "-" | `feature/user_auth!` â†’ `feature-user-auth-` |
| `lowercase` | Convert to lowercase | `Feature/User-Auth` â†’ `feature/user-auth` |
| `uppercase` | Convert to uppercase | `feature/user-auth` â†’ `FEATURE/USER-AUTH` |
| `kebab-case` | Clean kebab-case format | `Feature/User_Auth` â†’ `feature-user-auth` |
| `snake-case` | Convert to snake_case | `feature/user-auth` â†’ `feature_user_auth` |
| `camel-case` | Convert to camelCase | `feature/user-auth` â†’ `featureUserAuth` |
| `trim` | Remove leading/trailing spaces | ` feature/user-auth ` â†’ `feature/user-auth` |
| `remove-numbers` | Remove all numbers | `feature/123-user-auth` â†’ `feature/-user-auth` |
| `remove-special` | Remove all special characters | `feature/user-auth!` â†’ `featureuserauth` |
| `remove-spaces` | Remove all spaces | `feature/ user auth ` â†’ `feature/userauth` |
| `remove-dashes` | Remove all dashes | `feature-user-auth` â†’ `featureuserauth` |
| `remove-underscores` | Remove all underscores | `feature_user_auth` â†’ `featureuserauth` |
| `clean-dashes` | Clean multiple dashes | `feature--user---auth` â†’ `feature-user-auth` |
| `clean-underscores` | Clean multiple underscores | `feature__user___auth` â†’ `feature_user_auth` |
| `prefix` | Add prefix | `user-auth` â†’ `prefix-user-auth` |
| `suffix` | Add suffix | `user-auth` â†’ `user-auth-suffix` |

### Usage Examples

#### Single Transformation
```yaml
commit-prefix-transforms: "replace-slash"
# Result: feature/user-auth â†’ feature-user-auth
```

#### Multiple Transformations
```yaml
commit-prefix-transforms: "replace-all,lowercase,clean-dashes"
# Result: Feature/User_Auth! â†’ feature-user-auth
```

#### Advanced Example
```yaml
commit-prefix-transforms: "replace-all,remove-numbers,clean-dashes,kebab-case"
# Result: feature/123-user-auth_v2.0 â†’ feature-user-auth-v
```

#### Custom Workflow Examples
```yaml
# For clean commit prefixes
commit-prefix-transforms: "replace-all,kebab-case"

# For snake_case convention
commit-prefix-transforms: "replace-all,snake-case"

# For camelCase convention  
commit-prefix-transforms: "replace-all,camel-case"

# For uppercase convention
commit-prefix-transforms: "replace-all,uppercase,clean-dashes"
```

### Default Behavior
If no `commit-prefix-transforms` is specified, the default `replace-slash` transformation is applied, maintaining backward compatibility with existing configurations.
