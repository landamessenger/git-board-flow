# Bugbot

**Bugbot** uses OpenCode to analyze your branch against the base and report **potential problems** (bugs, risks, code quality issues) as comments on the **issue** and as **review comments** on open **pull requests**. You can then ask the bot to **fix** specific findings or to apply **general code changes**; it will apply edits, run your verify commands, and commit and push for you.

## Quick summary

| What you do | What happens |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Push** to a branch linked to an issue | Bugbot analyzes the diff and posts findings on the issue and on any open PR; updates or marks findings as resolved when the code changes. |
| **Comment** “fix it” / “fix all” (with permission) | OpenCode fixes the chosen findings; the action runs verify commands and commits and pushes. |
| **Comment** “add a test for X” (with permission) | OpenCode applies the change; the action runs verify commands and commits and pushes. |

**Requirements:** OpenCode must be configured (`opencode-server-url`, `opencode-model`). For autofix and do-user-request, the workflow must grant **`contents: write`** and only **organization members** or the **repository owner** can trigger file-modifying actions. See [Autofix](/bugbot/autofix#permissions) and [Configuration](/bugbot/configuration).
