# OpenCode Integration

Git Board Flow uses **OpenCode** for all AI-backed features: code analysis, progress detection, error detection, PR descriptions, and the copilot agent. OpenRouter has been removed in favor of OpenCode.

## Why OpenCode

- **Multi-provider**: OpenCode supports 75+ LLM providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, local models via Ollama, etc.), so you can switch between paid and free models without changing code.
- **Single backend**: One server (OpenCode) handles API keys and model routing; this action only needs the server URL and model name.
- **Consistent API**: The same configuration works for GitHub Actions and local CLI.

## Requirements

1. **OpenCode server** must be running and reachable (e.g. `http://localhost:4096` or your deployed URL).
2. **Model** in `provider/model` format (e.g. `opencode/kimi-k2.5-free`, `anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet`).
3. **API keys** are configured on the OpenCode server (not in this action). Use OpenCode's auth/config to add provider keys.

## Configuration

### GitHub Action inputs

| Input | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| `opencode-server-url` | OpenCode server URL | `http://localhost:4096` |
| `opencode-model` | Model in `provider/model` format | `opencode/kimi-k2.5-free` |
| `opencode-start-server` | If `true`, the action starts an OpenCode server at the beginning of the job and stops it when the job ends. No need to install or run OpenCode yourself. Requires provider API keys (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) as GitHub secrets. | `true` |

Example (using your own OpenCode server):

```yaml
- uses: landamessenger/git-board-flow@master
  with:
    opencode-server-url: 'http://your-opencode-host:4096'
    opencode-model: 'anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet'
```

Example (action starts and stops OpenCode for you; no separate server needed). Pass the provider API key via `env` so the OpenCode server can use it (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`):

```yaml
- uses: landamessenger/git-board-flow@master
  env:
    OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}   # or OPENROUTER_API_KEY, etc.
  with:
    opencode-start-server: true
    opencode-model: 'opencode/kimi-k2.5-free'
```

### Environment variables (CLI / local)

- `OPENCODE_SERVER_URL` – OpenCode server URL.
- `OPENCODE_MODEL` – Model in `provider/model` format.

### CLI options

- `--opencode-server-url <url>` – Override OpenCode server URL.
- `--opencode-model <model>` – Override model.

For the `copilot` command:
- `--output <format>` – Output format: `text` (default) or `json`. Use `json` to get `{ response, sessionId, diff }` for programmatic use.

## Running OpenCode

1. **GitHub Actions – managed server (easiest)**: Set `opencode-start-server: true`. The action will start an OpenCode server at the beginning of the job (`npx opencode-ai serve` on port 4096), wait until it is healthy, run the rest of the job using that server, and stop the server when the job ends. You do not need to install or run OpenCode yourself. Pass provider API keys via env (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) as GitHub secrets.

2. **Local / self-hosted**: Install OpenCode and run the server, e.g.:
   ```bash
   npx opencode-ai serve
   # or
   opencode serve --port 4096
   ```
3. **CI with your own server**: Run OpenCode in a job (e.g. in a container or as a service) and set `opencode-server-url`, or point `opencode-server-url` to a shared OpenCode instance your org hosts.

## Features using OpenCode

- **AI pull request description** – Generates PR descriptions from issue and diff.
- **Think / reasoning** – Deep code analysis and change proposals (OpenCode Plan agent).
- **Check progress** – Progress detection from branch vs issue description (OpenCode Plan agent).
- **Copilot** – Code analysis and manipulation agent (OpenCode Build agent).
- **Error detection** – Potential bugs and issues in the codebase (OpenCode Plan agent).
- **Recommend steps** – Suggests implementation steps from the issue description (OpenCode Plan agent).

All of these use the same OpenCode server and model configuration.

## How "check progress" works (e.g. "Progress 30%" in the issue)

Progress is updated **automatically on every push**: when the **commit (push) workflow** runs (e.g. `on: push`), the action computes size and progress from the branch diff, updates the progress label on the **issue**, and applies the same label to any **open PRs** for that branch. No separate "check progress" workflow is required.

You can also run progress check **on demand** with `single-action: check_progress_action` and `single-action-issue: <number>` (or the CLI `check-progress -i <number>`). The flow is:

1. **Trigger** – Either the push workflow (automatic) or a workflow that sets the single action to check progress (or the CLI with an issue number).

2. **Data gathering** – The action reads the **issue description**, finds the **branch** (from the push or by searching for a branch linked to the issue), and gets the **diff** of that branch vs the development branch (e.g. `develop`). The OpenCode agent runs in the workspace and computes the diff itself.

3. **AI analysis (OpenCode)** – The **OpenCode Plan agent** compares what was requested in the issue vs what is in the diff and returns `progress` (0–100) and `summary`.

4. **Result** – The progress label is set on the issue (and on any open PRs for that branch). When run from a workflow, **PublishResultUseCase** posts a comment on the issue with the percentage and summary.

## Can we avoid `opencode-server-url` and use a "master" OpenCode server?

**Current situation**

- OpenCode is **open-source and self-hosted**: there is no public "master" server or official opencode.ai cloud API for this action to point to by default.
- The server used by the action is the one **you** (or your org) configure in `opencode-server-url`.

**Options**

1. **Keep `opencode-server-url` (recommended)** – For local/CLI, the default `http://localhost:4096` works without setting a URL. For GitHub Actions you need an OpenCode server reachable from the runner, so you must set the URL (or use an org default via secret).

2. **Shared organization server** – Deploy OpenCode on an internal or cloud server with your provider API keys. In the workflow, pass that host as `opencode-server-url` (e.g. via secret). One "master" server for all repos that use the action.

3. **Managed server inside the job** – The action supports **`opencode-start-server: true`**: it starts OpenCode at the beginning of the job (`npx opencode-ai serve`), waits until it is ready, runs the flow, and stops the server at the end. No need to install or run OpenCode manually; only provider API keys as secrets. Heavier (startup time, first-time download of opencode-ai) but no external server required.

**Summary** – You need **some** OpenCode server (yours or shared). You can use one server for many repos (org "master") and keep the default `http://localhost:4096` for local development while requiring `opencode-server-url` (or an org default) in CI.

## Model format

Use `provider/model` as in OpenCode's config, for example:

- `opencode/kimi-k2.5-free` (free, Kimi K2.5)
- `openai/gpt-4o-mini`
- `openai/gpt-4o`
- `anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`
- `google/gemini-2.0-flash`

Check OpenCode's docs or `/config/providers` on your server for the exact model IDs.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Missing required AI configuration"**: Set `opencode-server-url` and `opencode-model` (or env vars).
- **Connection errors**: Ensure the OpenCode server is running and reachable from the runner (network/firewall, correct URL and port).
- **Auth errors**: Configure provider API keys in OpenCode (e.g. via OpenCode UI or config), not in this action.
