# Pull Request Management

When your workflow runs on `pull_request` events (e.g. opened, edited, labeled, unlabeled), Git Board Flow can:

- **Link the PR to the issue** associated with its branch and post a comment.
- **Add the PR to GitHub Projects** (using `project-ids`) and move it to the configured column.
- **Assign reviewers** (up to `desired-reviewers-count`).
- **Apply priority and size checks** (labels and thresholds).
- **Generate or update the PR description** with AI when `ai-pull-request-description` is true and OpenCode is configured.
- **Post comments with optional images** per branch type (feature, bugfix, docs, chore, hotfix, release).

## Example workflow

```yaml
name: Git Board Flow - Pull Request

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, edited, labeled, unlabeled]

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  git-board-flow-pull-requests:
    name: Git Board Flow - Pull Request
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Git Board Flow - Pull Request
        uses: landamessenger/git-board-flow@master
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
          project-ids: '2,3'
          commit-prefix-transforms: 'replace-slash'
```
