description: Steps for setting up Git Board Flow in your repository
---

Follow these steps to set up Git Board Flow in your repository:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a PAT">
    Define a personal access token to interact with issues, pull requests and boards.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Branch Structure">
    Set up your repository's branch structure:
    - **Primary Branch**: Default is `master` (or `main` for newer repositories)
    - **Development Branch**: Default is `develop`
    
    You can customize these branch names in the configuration. These branches will serve as the foundation for your development workflow, where feature, bugfix, hotfix, release, docs and chore branches will be created from and merged back into.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up Required Labels">
    Configure the following essential labels in your repository:
    - **Type Labels**: For categorizing issues (e.g., `feature`, `enhancement`, `bug`, `bugfix`, `hotfix`, `release`, `docs`, `documentation`, `chore`, `maintenance`)
    - **Action Labels**: For performing different actions (e.g., `branched`, `deploy`, `deployed`)
    - **Priority Labels**: For issue prioritization (e.g., `priority: high`, `priority: medium`, `priority: low`)
    - **Size Labels**: For control task sizes (e.g., `size: XS`, `size: S`, `size: M`, `size: L`, `size: XL`, `size: XXL`)
    
    These labels will be used by the action to automate workflows and organize your tasks effectively.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Implement Issue Templates">
    Create issue templates to standardize task creation (in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`):
    - **Feature**: `feature_request.yml` — use labels such as `enhancement`, `feature`; add `branched` when the user should get a branch, or set `branch-management-always: true`.
    - **Bugfix**: `bug_report.yml` — use labels `bug`, `bugfix`; add `branched` if needed.
    - **Docs**: `doc_update.yml` — use labels `documentation`, `docs`.
    - **Chore / maintenance**: `chore_task.yml` — use labels `chore`, `maintenance`.
    - **Hotfix**: `hotfix.yml` — use labels `hotfix`, `branched` (branch is created from main at latest tag).
    - **Release**: `release.yml` — use labels `release`, `branched` (branch is created from develop).
    - **Help**: `help_request.yml` — for support requests (no branch).
    Include the labels that match the [labels table](/issues#labels-by-issue-type-and-flow) so the action creates the correct branches and applies the right workflow.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install Git Board Flow">
    Add the GitHub Action to your repository by creating three workflow files (you can choose any names; common choices are `gbf_commit.yml`, `gbf_issue.yml`, `gbf_pr.yml` or names like "Git Board Flow - Commit", etc.):
    1. **Push (commit)** — runs on `push` to any branch: notifies issues of new commits, updates size and progress labels. Create e.g. `.github/workflows/gbf_commit.yml`.
    2. **Issues** — runs on `issues` (opened, edited, labeled, unlabeled): creates branches, links to projects, assignees. Create e.g. `.github/workflows/gbf_issue.yml`.
    3. **Pull requests** — runs on `pull_request`: links PR to issue, project, reviewers. Create e.g. `.github/workflows/gbf_pr.yml`.
    See the [README](https://github.com/vypdev/copilot#quick-start) for full YAML examples. These workflows will then automatically manage branches, project boards, and the relationship between issues and code.
