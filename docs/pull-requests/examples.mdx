# Examples

This page provides **concrete examples**: a full pull request workflow, enabling AI description, and using project columns and reviewers.

## Full pull request workflow

Example `.github/workflows/copilot_pull_request.yml` with common inputs:

```yaml
name: Copilot - Pull Request

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, reopened, edited, labeled, unlabeled, closed, assigned, unassigned, synchronize]

jobs:
  copilot-pull-requests:
    name: Copilot - Pull Request
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: vypdev/copilot@v2
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
          project-ids: ${{ vars.PROJECT_IDS }}
          project-column-pull-request-created: "In Progress"
          project-column-pull-request-in-progress: "In Progress"
          desired-reviewers-count: 1
          commit-prefix-transforms: replace-slash
          ai-pull-request-description: true
          opencode-model: ${{ vars.OPENCODE_MODEL }}
          opencode-server-url: ${{ vars.OPENCODE_SERVER_URL }}
          ai-ignore-files: build/*
          debug: ${{ vars.DEBUG }}
```

- **`token`** is required. Use a fine-grained PAT with repo and project permissions.
- **`project-ids`**: Comma-separated project IDs so PRs are linked and moved to the right column.
- **`project-column-*`**: Column names in your GitHub Project (must match exactly).
- **`desired-reviewers-count`**: Number of reviewers to assign (e.g. 1).
- **`commit-prefix-transforms`**: Transforms for commit prefix derived from branch name (e.g. `replace-slash` for `feature/123` → `feature-123`).
- **`ai-pull-request-description`**: Set to `true` to generate/update the PR description with OpenCode (requires `opencode-model` and `opencode-server-url`).

## Example: AI PR description only

Minimal workflow that only adds AI-generated PR description (no project linking):

```yaml
name: Copilot - Pull Request

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  copilot-pull-requests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: vypdev/copilot@v2
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
          ai-pull-request-description: true
          opencode-server-url: ${{ secrets.OPENCODE_SERVER_URL }}
          opencode-model: "anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet"
```

The PR must have an **issue linked** (via branch name) and the issue must have a **non-empty description**. See [AI PR description](/pull-requests/ai-description).

## Example: Project columns and reviewers

Link PRs to a board and assign two reviewers:

```yaml
- uses: vypdev/copilot@v2
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
    project-ids: "2,3"
    project-column-pull-request-created: "In Review"
    desired-reviewers-count: 2
```

Ensure the project has a column named **"In Review"** (or use your actual column name).

## Example: Images on PR comments

Enable images in PR comments and set URLs for feature PRs:

```yaml
- uses: vypdev/copilot@v2
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
    images-on-pull-request: true
    images-pull-request-feature: "https://example.com/images/feature-pr.png"
```

Other branch types: `images-pull-request-bugfix`, `images-pull-request-docs`, `images-pull-request-chore`, `images-pull-request-hotfix`, `images-pull-request-release`. See [Configuration](/configuration).
