# Pull Request Management

When your workflow runs on **`pull_request`** events (e.g. opened, edited, labeled), Copilot performs a set of actions so that PRs stay linked to issues, projects, and team workflows. It can link the PR to the issue, add it to project boards, assign reviewers, apply size and priority labels, and optionally generate the PR description with AI.

## Quick summary

| What happens | What Copilot does |
|--------------|-------------------|
| A **PR is opened or updated** | Links the PR to the issue (from branch name); adds the PR to configured projects and moves it to the right column; assigns reviewers; computes size and priority from diff and updates labels; optionally generates or updates the PR description with AI. |
| **Push** to the PR branch | Commit workflow runs; Bugbot can post findings as review comments and update/sync with the issue. You can ask the bot to fix findings from a comment. See [Bugbot](/bugbot). |

**Bugbot** (potential problems) runs on **push** or on demand; findings appear as **review comments** on the PR and as **comments on the linked issue**. For full details, see [Bugbot](/bugbot).
