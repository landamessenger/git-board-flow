# Pull Request Management

When your workflow runs on `pull_request` events (e.g. opened, edited, labeled, unlabeled), Git Board Flow performs a set of actions so that PRs stay linked to issues, projects, and team workflows.

## Enable the action for pull requests

Create a workflow file (e.g. `.github/workflows/gbf_pull_request.yml`) that runs on `pull_request`:

```yaml
name: Git Board Flow - Pull Request

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, edited, labeled, unlabeled]

jobs:
  git-board-flow-pull-requests:
    name: Git Board Flow - Pull Request
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: landamessenger/git-board-flow@master
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
          project-ids: '2,3'
          commit-prefix-transforms: 'replace-slash'
```

<Info>
  For **AI-generated PR descriptions**, add `ai-pull-request-description: true` and configure [OpenCode](/opencode-integration). See [AI PR description](/pull-requests/ai-description) for details.

## What the action does on pull requests

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **PR–issue linking** | Links the pull request to the issue associated with its branch (from the branch name, e.g. `feature/123-title`) and posts a comment on the PR. |
| **Project linking** | Adds the PR to the configured GitHub Projects (`project-ids`) and moves it to the configured column (e.g. "In Progress"). |
| **Reviewers** | Assigns up to `desired-reviewers-count` reviewers. |
| **Priority & size** | Applies priority labels and size labels (XS–XXL) based on configured thresholds (lines, files, commits). |
| **AI-generated PR description** | When enabled, generates or updates the PR description using OpenCode and your repo's PR template. See [AI PR description](/pull-requests/ai-description). |
| **Comments & images** | Posts a comment with optional images per branch type (feature, bugfix, docs, chore, hotfix, release). |
