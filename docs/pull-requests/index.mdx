# Pull Request Management

When your workflow runs on `pull_request` events (e.g. opened, edited, labeled, unlabeled), Copilot performs a set of actions so that PRs stay linked to issues, projects, and team workflows.

## Enable the action for pull requests

Create a workflow file (e.g. `.github/workflows/copilot_pull_request.yml`) that runs on `pull_request`:

```yaml
name: Copilot - Pull Request

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, edited, labeled, unlabeled]

jobs:
  copilot-pull-requests:
    name: Copilot - Pull Request
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: vypdev/copilot@master
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
          project-ids: '2,3'
          commit-prefix-transforms: 'replace-slash'
```

<Info>
  For **AI-generated PR descriptions**, add `ai-pull-request-description: true` and configure [OpenCode](/opencode-integration). See [AI PR description](/pull-requests/ai-description) for details.

## What the action does on pull requests

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **PR–issue linking** | Links the pull request to the issue associated with its branch (from the branch name, e.g. `feature/123-title`) and posts a comment on the PR. |
| **Project linking** | Adds the PR to the configured GitHub Projects (`project-ids`) and moves it to the configured column (e.g. "In Progress"). |
| **Reviewers** | Assigns up to `desired-reviewers-count` reviewers. |
| **Priority & size** | Applies priority labels and size labels (XS–XXL) based on configured thresholds (lines, files, commits). |
| **AI-generated PR description** | When enabled, generates or updates the PR description using OpenCode and your repo's PR template. See [AI PR description](/pull-requests/ai-description). |
| **Comments & images** | Posts a comment with optional images per branch type (feature, bugfix, docs, chore, hotfix, release). |

## Bugbot (potential problems) {#bugbot-potential-problems}

When the **push** workflow runs (or the single action `detect_potential_problems_action`), OpenCode analyzes the branch vs the base and posts **review comments** on the PR at the relevant file and line for each finding (potential bugs, risks, or improvements). When OpenCode later reports a finding as resolved (e.g. after code changes), the action **marks that review thread as resolved**, so the PR review reflects the current status. Findings are also summarized as **comments on the linked issue**; see [Issues → Bugbot](/issues#bugbot-potential-problems). Configure minimum severity with `bugbot-severity` and excluded paths with `ai-ignore-files` in [Configuration](/configuration).
