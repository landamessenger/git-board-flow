# Examples

This page provides **concrete examples**: workflow YAML and CLI commands for each single action.

## Workflow: check progress

Run progress check for issue `123` (checkout the branch first if you need a specific branch):

```yaml
jobs:
  run-check-progress:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          ref: feature/123-add-login   # optional: branch to analyze
      - uses: vypdev/copilot@v1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
          single-action: check_progress_action
          single-action-issue: "123"
          opencode-model: ${{ vars.OPENCODE_MODEL }}
```

## Workflow: Bugbot (detect potential problems)

Run Bugbot detection for issue `456` on the current checkout:

```yaml
jobs:
  run-bugbot:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: vypdev/copilot@v1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
          single-action: detect_potential_problems_action
          single-action-issue: "456"
          opencode-model: ${{ vars.OPENCODE_MODEL }}
          opencode-server-url: ${{ vars.OPENCODE_SERVER_URL }}
```

See [Bugbot](/bugbot) for full documentation.

## Workflow: recommend steps

Get implementation steps for issue `789` and post them as a comment:

```yaml
- uses: vypdev/copilot@v1
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
    single-action: recommend_steps_action
    single-action-issue: "789"
    opencode-model: ${{ vars.OPENCODE_MODEL }}
```

## Workflow: think (no issue)

Run Think with a question (e.g. from `workflow_dispatch` with an input):

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      question:
        description: 'Question for Think'
        required: true
        type: string

jobs:
  think:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: vypdev/copilot@v1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
          single-action: think_action
          # Think can use repo context; for a question you may need to pass it via an env or a custom step)
```

For a **question** from the CLI, use the **CLI** (see below); the workflow `think_action` uses repo context without a direct “question” input in the action. See [Workflow & CLI](/single-actions/workflow-and-cli).

## Workflow: create release

Create a GitHub release with version, title, and changelog:

```yaml
- uses: vypdev/copilot@v1
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
    single-action: create_release
    single-action-version: "1.2.0"
    single-action-title: "Release 1.2.0"
    single-action-changelog: |
      ## New features
      - Added user login
      ## Fixes
      - Fixed null check in API
```

Changelog can be read from a file or generated in a previous step and passed as input.

## Workflow: create tag

Create only a tag (no release body):

```yaml
- uses: vypdev/copilot@v1
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
    single-action: create_tag
    single-action-version: "1.2.0"
```

## Workflow: deployed

Mark issue `100` as deployed (e.g. from your release workflow):

```yaml
- uses: vypdev/copilot@v1
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
    single-action: deployed_action
    single-action-issue: "100"
```

## Workflow: initial setup

Run initial setup (labels, issue types, verify access):

```yaml
- uses: vypdev/copilot@v1
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
    single-action: initial_setup
```

Often run once per repo or after adding new label/type config.

## CLI examples

Run the CLI from the **repository root** (with `.env` containing `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` and optional OpenCode vars). Commands mirror the single actions.

### check-progress

```bash
copilot check-progress -i 123 -t $PAT
# Or with branch
node build/cli/index.js check-progress -i 123 -b feature/123-add-login -t $PAT
```

### detect-potential-problems (Bugbot)

```bash
copilot detect-potential-problems -i 456 -t $PAT
# With branch and debug
copilot detect-potential-problems -i 456 -b feature/456-fix-bug -t $PAT -d
```

### recommend-steps

```bash
copilot recommend-steps -i 789 -t $PAT
```

### think

```bash
copilot think -q "Where is authentication validated?" -t $PAT
```

### copilot (CLI-only, Build agent)

```bash
copilot copilot -p "Explain the main function" -t $PAT
```

Common options: **`-t`** / **`--token`** (PAT), **`-d`** / **`--debug`**, **`--opencode-server-url`**, **`--opencode-model`**. See [Workflow & CLI](/single-actions/workflow-and-cli) and [Testing OpenCode Plan Locally](/testing-opencode-plan-locally).
