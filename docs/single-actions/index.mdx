# Single Actions

When you set the **`single-action`** input (and any required targets such as `single-action-issue` or `single-action-version`), Copilot runs **only** that action and skips the normal issue, pull request, and push pipelines. Use this for on-demand runs: progress check without pushing, Bugbot detection, recommend steps, think, create release or tag, mark deployed, or initial setup.

## Quick summary

| Action type | Typical use |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Progress / Bugbot / Recommend steps** | Run on demand with `single-action-issue`; no need to push or wait for the commit workflow. |
| **Think** | Deep code analysis or questions; no issue required. Use from workflow or CLI with `-q "<question>"`. |
| **Release / Tag** | Create a GitHub release or tag with `single-action-version` (and for release: title, changelog). |
| **Deployed / Setup** | Mark an issue as deployed, or run initial setup (labels, issue types). |

<Info>
**Actions that fail the job** if the last step fails: `publish_github_action`, `create_release`, `deployed_action`, `create_tag`. The workflow will be marked as failed so you can act on it.
