# Usage Examples

Here are some common use cases and workflow examples for Git Board Flow.

## 1. Basic Issue Management

This example shows how to set up Git Board Flow for basic issue management with project integration:

```yaml
name: Git Board Flow - Issue
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, edited, labeled, unlabeled]
jobs:
  git-board-flow:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: landamessenger/git-board-flow@master
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          github-token-personal: ${{ secrets.REPO_PAT }}
          project-urls: https://github.com/orgs/your-org/projects/1
          branch-management-always: "true"
```

## 2. Pull Request Management

This example demonstrates how to configure Git Board Flow for pull request management with custom reviewer settings:

```yaml
name: Git Board Flow - Pull Request
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, edited, labeled, unlabeled]
jobs:
  git-board-flow:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: landamessenger/git-board-flow@master
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          github-token-personal: ${{ secrets.REPO_PAT }}
          desired-reviewers-count: "2"
          desired-assignees-count: "1"
```

## 3. Commit Monitoring

This example shows how to set up commit monitoring with custom prefix rules:

```yaml
name: Git Board Flow - Commit
on:
  push:
    branches: ['**']
jobs:
  git-board-flow:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: landamessenger/git-board-flow@master
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          github-token-personal: ${{ secrets.REPO_PAT }}
          commit-prefix-builder: |
            branchName.replace("/", "-")
```

## 4. Complete Workflow Setup

For a complete setup that includes all features, you'll need to create three workflow files:

1. `.github/workflows/git-board-issue.yml` - For issue management
2. `.github/workflows/git-board-pr.yml` - For pull request management
3. `.github/workflows/git-board-commit.yml` - For commit monitoring

This setup ensures that Git Board Flow can handle all aspects of your repository's workflow.
