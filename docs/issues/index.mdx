# Issues

Copilot automates **issue tracking** so that labels, branch creation, project linking, and assignees stay in sync with your Git-Flow workflow. When you open or update an issue (or add labels), the action can create branches, link the issue to boards, assign members, and later notify you of commits and close the issue when branches are merged.

## Quick summary

| What you do | What Copilot can do |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Open an issue with a **type label** (e.g. `feature`, `bugfix`) | Link to projects, assign members; when **branch launcher** label is added (e.g. `branched`), create the branch from develop (or main for hotfix). |
| Add **`deploy`** to a release/hotfix issue | Trigger the release or hotfix workflow (e.g. deploy). |
| Push commits to the issue’s branch | Post commit notifications on the issue; optionally reopen the issue if it was closed. |
| Merge the branch (e.g. into develop) | Automatically close the issue when the branch is merged. |

**Bugbot** (potential problems) runs on **push** (or single action) and posts findings on the issue and on open PRs; you can ask the bot to fix findings from a comment. See [Bugbot](/bugbot) for full details.

For **step-by-step flows** per issue type (branch naming, source branch, deploy), see the issue type pages: [Feature](/issues/type/feature), [Bugfix](/issues/type/bugfix), [Docs](/issues/type/docs), [Chore](/issues/type/chore), [Hotfix](/issues/type/hotfix), [Release](/issues/type/release).
