Git Board Flow automates issue tracking, ensuring smooth branch management and seamless project integration.  

To enable the GitHub Action for issues, create a workflow with the following configuration:  

```yml
name: Git Board Flow - Issue

on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, reopened, edited, labeled, unlabeled, assigned, unassigned]

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.issue.number || github.ref }}

jobs:
  git-board-issues:
    name: Git Board - Issue
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: landamessenger/git-board-flow@v1
        with:
          project-ids: 1,2
          token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
```

### Member Assignment

Git Board Flow rolls the dice for you by automatically assigning newly created issues to a member of the organization or repository.

<Card title="How many members do we assign?" icon="person-circle-exclamation">
  
  The issue is assigned to its creator if they belong to the organization. We will assign additional members if needed.

  ```yml
  jobs:
    git-board-issues:
      name: Git Board - Issue
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: landamessenger/git-board-flow@v1
          with:
            desired-assignees-count: 1 // [!code highlight]
  ```
</Card>

### Board Assignment

Git Board Flow takes care of organizing your issues by automatically assigning newly created issues to a designated project board, ensuring seamless tracking and management.

<Warning>Linking the issue to a board requires a Personal Access Token (PAT).</Warning>

<Card title="How many boards do you want to work with?" icon="table-columns">
  
  Define the links to all the boards where you want to track the issue.

  ```yml
  jobs:
    git-board-issues:
      name: Git Board - Issue
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: landamessenger/git-board-flow@v1
          with:
            project-ids: 1, 2 // [!code highlight]
  ```
</Card>

### Branch Management

Issues usually require new changes (unless they are inquiries or help requests).

Once members of the organization (or repository) add a specific label, the necessary branches are automatically created to save time and effort for developers.

Some types of issues (`hotfix` and `release`) create branches automatically. This only happens when the issue creator is a member of the organization.

<Card title="How to branch issues" icon="code-branch">
  
  `branched` is the default label for running this branch management on non-mandatory branched issues.

  ```yml
  jobs:
    git-board-issues:
      name: Git Board - Issue
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: landamessenger/git-board-flow@v1
          with:
            branch-management-launcher-label: branched // [!code highlight]
  ```
</Card>

<Card title="Naming conventions" icon="i-cursor">
  `main` or `master`? `develop` or `dev`? `feature` or `feat`?

  You can define the branch naming convention that best suits your project. Here are all the possibilities and their default values:

  ```yml
  jobs:
    git-board-issues:
      name: Git Board - Issue
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: landamessenger/git-board-flow@v1
          with:
            main-branch: master // [!code highlight]
            development-branch: develop // [!code highlight]
            docs-tree: docs // [!code highlight]
            chore-tree: chore // [!code highlight]
            feature-tree: feature // [!code highlight]
            bugfix-tree: bugfix // [!code highlight]
            hotfix-tree: hotfix // [!code highlight]
            release-tree: release // [!code highlight]
  ```
</Card>

### Smart Workflow Guidance

Many developers are familiar with the Git-Flow methodology, but that doesn’t prevent mistakes from happening during the process of creating new features, maintaining code or documentation, fixing bugs, and deploying new versions. Git-Board-Flow will remind you of key steps to minimize these errors as much as possible. Even if you're not familiar with the Git-Flow methodology, you'll be able to manage branches easily and confidently.

### Real-Time Code Tracking

Issues take time to be resolved, and interest in their progress increases. Therefore, any changes in the branches created by the issue will be notified as comments, providing real-time feedback on the issue's progress.

### Auto-Closure

Forget about closing issues when development is complete, Git-Board-Flow will automatically close them once the branches created by the issue are successfully merged.
