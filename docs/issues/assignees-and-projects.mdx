# Assignees and projects

Copilot can **assign members** to issues and **link issues to GitHub Project** boards so that new issues are tracked in the right place and have owners.

## Member assignment

When the action runs on an issue (e.g. opened or labeled), it can assign **up to N members** of the organization or repository. This is controlled by **`desired-assignees-count`** (default: `1`, max: `10`).

### How assignees are chosen

- The **issue creator** is assigned first **if** they belong to the organization (or are the repo owner for user repos).
- If you need more than one assignee, the action assigns **additional** members up to `desired-assignees-count`. The exact selection logic (e.g. round-robin, random) depends on the implementation; the goal is to spread work across the team.

### Example

Set the number of assignees in the workflow:

```yaml
- uses: vypdev/copilot@v2
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
    project-ids: ${{ vars.PROJECT_IDS }}
    desired-assignees-count: 1
```

Use a higher value to assign more people (e.g. `2` or `3`), up to the configured maximum.

## Project (board) linking

Linking issues to **GitHub Project** boards requires a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** with access to the repository and to the project(s). The action uses **`project-ids`** to know which boards to link to.

### project-ids

- **Format:** Comma-separated list of **project IDs** (numeric). You find the project ID in the project URL or via the API; it is **not** the project name.
- **Effect:** When the action runs (e.g. on issue opened or edited), it **links the issue** to each of these projects and can **move the issue** to a column (e.g. "Todo", "In Progress") based on **`project-column-issue-created`** and **`project-column-issue-in-progress`** (see [Configuration](/configuration)).

### How many boards?

You can link each issue to **multiple** boards by listing several IDs:

```yaml
- uses: vypdev/copilot@v2
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
    project-ids: '1,2,3'
```

Use variables or secrets if the IDs differ per environment:

```yaml
project-ids: ${{ vars.PROJECT_IDS }}
```

<Warning>
Linking the issue to a board requires a PAT with **project** (and repository) permissions. See [Authentication](/authentication) for the required scopes.
</Warning>

## Summary

| Input | Purpose | Default |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `desired-assignees-count` | Number of assignees (creator + additional up to this count) | 1 (max 10) |
| `project-ids` | Comma-separated project IDs to link the issue to | — |
