# Examples

This page provides **concrete examples**: a full issue workflow, optional inputs for assignees and projects, and example labels and branch names.

## Full issue workflow

Example `.github/workflows/copilot_issue.yml` with common inputs:

```yaml
name: Copilot - Issue

on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, reopened, edited, labeled, unlabeled, assigned, unassigned]

jobs:
  copilot-issues:
    name: Copilot - Issue
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: vypdev/copilot@v1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
          project-ids: ${{ vars.PROJECT_IDS }}
          desired-assignees-count: 1
          branch-management-launcher-label: branched
          main-branch: main
          development-branch: develop
          feature-tree: feature
          bugfix-tree: bugfix
          hotfix-tree: hotfix
          release-tree: release
          opencode-model: ${{ vars.OPENCODE_MODEL }}
          ai-ignore-files: build/*
          debug: ${{ vars.DEBUG }}
```

- **`token`** is required. Use a fine-grained PAT with repo and project permissions (see [Authentication](/authentication)).
- **`project-ids`**: Comma-separated project IDs so issues (and later PRs) are linked to boards.
- **`desired-assignees-count`**: Number of assignees (e.g. 1).
- **`branch-management-launcher-label`**: Add this label (e.g. `branched`) to trigger branch creation for feature/bugfix/docs/chore.
- **`main-branch`** / **`development-branch`**: Match your repo (e.g. `main` and `develop`).
- **`*-tree`**: Branch prefixes (e.g. `feature/123-title`). Omit if you keep defaults.

## Example: branch-management-always

Create branches as soon as the issue has a type label (no launcher label):

```yaml
- uses: vypdev/copilot@v1
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
    project-ids: ${{ vars.PROJECT_IDS }}
    branch-management-always: true
```

Then opening an issue with label `feature` creates the branch immediately.

## Example labels on an issue

| Goal | Labels to add |
|------|----------------|
| New feature | `feature` then `branched` (or use `branch-management-always: true` and only `feature`) |
| Bug fix | `bugfix` then `branched` |
| Documentation | `docs` or `documentation` then `branched` |
| Chore / maintenance | `chore` or `maintenance` then `branched` |
| Hotfix (production) | `hotfix` (branch created from main; add `deploy` to trigger hotfix workflow) |
| Release | `release` (branch from develop; add `deploy` to trigger release workflow) |
| Question (no branch) | `question` |
| Help request (no branch) | `help` |

## Example branch names

Assuming defaults (`feature-tree: feature`, `development-branch: develop`):

| Issue | Label(s) | Branch created |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| #42 "Add login page" | `feature`, `branched` | `feature/42-add-login-page` from `develop` |
| #99 "Fix null in API" | `bugfix`, `branched` | `bugfix/99-fix-null-in-api` from `develop` |
| #100 "Critical payment bug" | `hotfix` | `hotfix/100-critical-payment-bug` from `main` (at latest tag) |
| #101 "Release 1.2.0" | `release` | `release/101-release-1-2-0` from `develop` |

## Deploy workflow filenames

If you use **release** or **hotfix** and the **`deploy`** label, the action **dispatches** a workflow by **filename**. Defaults:

- **`release-workflow`**: `release_workflow.yml`
- **`hotfix-workflow`**: `hotfix_workflow.yml`

Your `.github/workflows/` must contain files with these exact names (or pass the correct names in the action inputs). Example:

```yaml
# In copilot_issue.yml (or wherever you call Copilot for issues)
- uses: vypdev/copilot@v1
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
    release-workflow: release_workflow.yml
    hotfix-workflow: hotfix_workflow.yml
```
