Bugfix issues are used to track and resolve bugs in the project. These issues help maintain the quality and reliability of the codebase by addressing problems that affect functionality.

## Label

All bugfix issues are created with the `bugfix-label`. The default label for creating a bugfix-type issue is `bugfix`. You can configure this label as follows:

```yml
jobs:
  git-board-issues:
    name: Git Board - Issue
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: landamessenger/git-board-flow@v1
        with:
          bugfix-label: bugfix // [!code highlight]
```

## Naming

The default tree for creating bugfix branches is `bugfix`. You can configure this tree name as follows:

```yml
jobs:
  git-board-issues:
    name: Git Board - Issue
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: landamessenger/git-board-flow@v1
        with:
          bugfix-tree: bugfix // [!code highlight]
```

Bugfix branches follow this naming convention:

```
bugfix/NUM-ISSUE-issue-name
```

For example:
```
bugfix/123-fix-login-validation
```

## Source

Bugfix branches are created from the development branch. By default, bugfix branches are created from the `develop` branch. You can configure the development branch name as shown below:

```yml
jobs:
  git-board-issues:
    name: Git Board - Issue
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: landamessenger/git-board-flow@v1
        with:
          development-branch: develop // [!code highlight]
```

## Images

You can configure custom images to be displayed in the comments of bugfix issues. These images will be randomly selected and displayed when Git Board Flow performs actions on the issue.

To configure the images, provide a comma-separated list of image URLs in the `images-issue-bugfix` input:

```yml
jobs:
  git-board-issues:
    name: Git Board - Issue
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: landamessenger/git-board-flow@v1
        with:
          images-issue-bugfix: url1, url2, url3 // [!code highlight]
```

## Template

You can use this template for bugfix issues that helps capture all the necessary information. The template includes fields for:

- Checking for duplicate issues
- Selecting affected actions and platforms
- Providing a detailed bug description
- Including steps to reproduce
- Specifying git-board-flow version
- Adding relevant log output
- Including additional context and comments

You can find this template in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml`. Below is an example of how the template looks when creating a new bugfix issue:
