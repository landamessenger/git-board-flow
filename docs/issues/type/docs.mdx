Documentation issues are used to track tasks related to improving or creating documentation in the project. These issues help maintain and enhance the project's documentation quality.

## Label

All documentation issues are created with the `docs-label`.

<Card title="How do I run it?" icon="tag">
  
  `docs` is the default label for creating a docs-type issue. You can configure the label for this type of issue as follows:

  ```yml
  jobs:
    git-board-issues:
      name: Git Board - Issue
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Checkout Repository
          uses: actions/checkout@v4

        - name: Git Board - Issue
          uses: ./
          with:
            docs-label: docs // [!code highlight]
  ```
</Card>

## Branch Naming

When working on a documentation issue, create a new branch following this pattern:

  `docs` is the default tree for creating documentation branches. You can configure the tree name for this type of branch as follows:

  ```yml
  jobs:
    git-board-issues:
      name: Git Board - Issue
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Checkout Repository
          uses: actions/checkout@v4

        - name: Git Board - Issue
          uses: ./
          with:
            docs-tree: docs // [!code highlight]
  ```
</Card>

```
docs/NUM-ISSUE-issue-name
```

For example:
```
docs/123-update-readme-instructions
```

### Branch Origin

The branch will be created from the development branch.

<Card title="Branch Source Configuration" icon="code-branch">
  
  Documentation branches are created from the `develop` branch by default. You can configure the development branch name as shown below.

  ```yml
  jobs:
    git-board-issues:
      name: Git Board - Issue
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Checkout Repository
          uses: actions/checkout@v4

        - name: Git Board - Issue
          uses: ./
          with:
            development-branch: develop // [!code highlight]
  ```
