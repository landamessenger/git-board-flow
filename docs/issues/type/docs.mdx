Documentation issues are used to track tasks related to improving or creating documentation in the project. These issues help maintain and enhance the project's documentation quality.

## <Icon name="tag">Label</Icon>

All documentation issues are created with the `docs-label`. The default label for creating a docs-type issue is `docs`. You can configure this label as follows:

```yml
jobs:
  git-board-issues:
    name: Git Board - Issue
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Git Board - Issue
        uses: ./
        with:
          docs-label: docs // [!code highlight]
```

## <Icon name="i-cursor">Naming</Icon>

The default tree for creating documentation branches is `docs`. You can configure this tree name as follows:

```yml
jobs:
  git-board-issues:
    name: Git Board - Issue
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Git Board - Issue
        uses: ./
        with:
          docs-tree: docs // [!code highlight]
```

```
docs/NUM-ISSUE-issue-name
```

For example:
```
docs/123-update-readme-instructions
```

## <Icon name="code-branch">Source</Icon>

Documentation branches are created from the development branch. By default, documentation branches are created from the `develop` branch. You can configure the development branch name as shown below:

```yml
jobs:
  git-board-issues:
    name: Git Board - Issue
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Git Board - Issue
        uses: ./
        with:
          development-branch: develop // [!code highlight]
```
