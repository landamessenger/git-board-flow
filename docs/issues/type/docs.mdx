Documentation issues are used to track tasks related to improving or creating documentation in the project. These issues help maintain and enhance the project's documentation quality.

## Label

All documentation issues are created with the `docs-label`. The default label for creating a docs-type issue is `docs`. You can configure this label as follows:

```yml
jobs:
  git-board-issues:
    name: Git Board - Issue
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Git Board - Issue
        uses: ./
        with:
          docs-label: docs // [!code highlight]
```

## Naming

The default tree for creating documentation branches is `docs`. You can configure this tree name as follows:

```yml
jobs:
  git-board-issues:
    name: Git Board - Issue
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Git Board - Issue
        uses: ./
        with:
          docs-tree: docs // [!code highlight]
```

```
docs/NUM-ISSUE-issue-name
```

For example:
```
docs/123-update-readme-instructions
```

## Source

Documentation branches are created from the development branch. By default, documentation branches are created from the `develop` branch. You can configure the development branch name as shown below:

```yml
jobs:
  git-board-issues:
    name: Git Board - Issue
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Git Board - Issue
        uses: ./
        with:
          development-branch: develop // [!code highlight]
```

## Images

You can configure custom images to be displayed in the comments of documentation issues. These images will be randomly selected and displayed when Git Board Flow performs actions on the issue.

To configure the images, provide a comma-separated list of image URLs in the `images-issue-docs` input:

```yml
jobs:
  git-board-issues:
    name: Git Board - Issue
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Git Board - Issue
        uses: ./
        with:
          images-issue-docs: url1, url2, url3 // [!code highlight]
```

## Template

You can use this template for documentation issues that helps capture all the necessary information. The template includes fields for:

- Checking for duplicate issues
- Selecting which part of the documentation needs updating
- Describing the proposed changes
- Explaining why the update is needed
- Adding additional context and resources

You can find this template in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/doc_update.yml`. Below is an example of how the template looks when creating a new documentation issue:

```yml
