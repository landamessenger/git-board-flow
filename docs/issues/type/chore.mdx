Chore issues are used to track maintenance tasks and housekeeping activities in the project. These issues help keep the project organized and up-to-date.

## Label

All chore issues are created with the `chore-label`. The default label for creating a chore-type issue is `chore`. You can configure this label as follows:

```yml
jobs:
  git-board-issues:
    name: Git Board - Issue
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: landamessenger/git-board-flow@v1
        with:
          chore-label: chore // [!code highlight]
```

## Naming

The default tree for creating chore branches is `chore`. You can configure this tree name as follows:

```yml
jobs:
  git-board-issues:
    name: Git Board - Issue
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: landamessenger/git-board-flow@v1
        with:
          chore-tree: chore // [!code highlight]
```

Chore branches follow this naming convention:

```
chore/NUM-ISSUE-issue-name
```

For example:
```
chore/123-update-dependencies
```

## Source

Chore branches are created from the development branch. By default, chore branches are created from the `develop` branch. You can configure the development branch name as shown below:

```yml
jobs:
  git-board-issues:
    name: Git Board - Issue
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: landamessenger/git-board-flow@v1
        with:
          development-branch: develop // [!code highlight]
```

## Images

You can configure custom images to be displayed in the comments of chore issues. These images will be randomly selected and displayed when Git Board Flow performs actions on the issue.

To configure the images, provide a comma-separated list of image URLs in the `images-issue-chore` input:

```yml
jobs:
  git-board-issues:
    name: Git Board - Issue
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: landamessenger/git-board-flow@v1
        with:
          images-issue-chore: url1, url2, url3 // [!code highlight]
```

## Template

You can use this template for chore issues that helps capture all the necessary information. The template includes fields for:

- Checking for duplicate issues
- Selecting the maintenance task area (CI/CD, Dependencies, Code Refactoring, etc.)
- Providing a detailed task description
- Explaining current issues and inefficiencies
- Describing expected impact and improvements
- Documenting alternatives considered
- Adding additional context and comments

You can find this template in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/chore_task.yml`. Below is an example of how the template looks when creating a new chore issue:

```yml
