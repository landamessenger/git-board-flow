Feature issues are used to track new functionality and enhancements to the project. These issues help organize and manage the development of new features from conception to implementation.

## Label

All feature issues are created with the `feature-label`. The default label for creating a feature-type issue is `feature`. You can configure this label as follows:

```yml
jobs:
  git-board-issues:
    name: Git Board - Issue
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: landamessenger/git-board-flow@v1
        with:
          feature-label: feature // [!code highlight]
```

## Naming

The default tree for creating feature branches is `feature`. You can configure this tree name as follows:

```yml
jobs:
  git-board-issues:
    name: Git Board - Issue
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: landamessenger/git-board-flow@v1
        with:
          feature-tree: feature // [!code highlight]
```

Feature branches follow this naming convention:

```
feature/NUM-ISSUE-issue-name
```

For example:
```
feature/123-add-user-authentication
```

## Source

Feature branches are created from the development branch. By default, feature branches are created from the `develop` branch. You can configure the development branch name as shown below:

```yml
jobs:
  git-board-issues:
    name: Git Board - Issue
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: landamessenger/git-board-flow@v1
        with:
          development-branch: develop // [!code highlight]
```

## Images

You can configure custom images to be displayed in the comments of feature issues. These images will be randomly selected and displayed when Git Board Flow performs actions on the issue.

To configure the images, provide a comma-separated list of image URLs in the `images-issue-feature` input:

```yml
jobs:
  git-board-issues:
    name: Git Board - Issue
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: landamessenger/git-board-flow@v1
        with:
          images-issue-feature: url1, url2, url3 // [!code highlight]
```

## Template

You can use this template for feature issues that helps capture all the necessary information. The template includes fields for:

- Checking for existing issues and feature requests
- Selecting the feature scope (UI, Performance, Documentation, etc.)
- Selecting affected actions (Issues, PRs, Commits)
- Providing a detailed description of the idea/improvement
- Explaining current limitations and challenges
- Describing expected impact and benefits
- Considering alternative solutions
- Specifying git-board-flow version
- Adding additional context and comments

You can find this template in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml`. Below is an example of how the template looks when creating a new feature issue:

```yml
