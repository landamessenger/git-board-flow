Release issues are used to track and manage the process of creating new versions of your software. These issues help coordinate the release process, ensuring that all planned features and fixes are properly integrated and tested before being deployed to production.

## Workflow

The release process follows these steps after creating an issue with `release` and `branched` labels:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Release Branch">
    A release branch is created from `development-branch`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Feature Branch">
    A feature branch is created from the release branch to implement any remaining changes
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply Changes">
    The needed changes are applied on the feature branch
  </Step>
  <Step title="Merge Feature Branch">
    The feature branch is merged back into the release branch via Pull Request
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy New Version">
    A new version is deployed from the release branch by adding the `deploy-label` to the issue
  </Step>
  <Step title="Merge Release Branch">
    After successful deployment, the release branch is merged:
    - First into `main-branch` with the new version tag
    - Then back into `development-branch` to keep changes synchronized
  </Step>
  <Step title="Close Issue">
    The issue is automatically closed with the `deployed-label` label once the process completes
  </Step>
</Steps>

This workflow ensures that releases are properly planned, tested, and deployed while maintaining code quality and proper version control.

<Warning>Deploy workflow files should be located in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository.</Warning>

<Card title="How do I trigger the release deployment?" icon="code-branch">
  Once your changes are merged into the `release` branch and ready for deployment, simply add the **deploy-label** to the issue. This will automatically trigger the release deployment workflow.

  By default, the deployment is triggered with the `deploy` label and uses the `release_workflow.yml` workflow file. You can customize these settings as shown below:
  
  ```yml
  jobs:
    git-board-issues:
      name: Git Board - Issue
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Checkout Repository
          uses: actions/checkout@v4

        - name: Git Board - Issue
          uses: ./
          with:
            deploy-label: deploy // [!code highlight]
            release-workflow: release_workflow.yml // [!code highlight]
  ```
</Card>

<Card title="How do I control the end of the deployment?" icon="rocket">
  The release deployment workflow is defined in the `release_workflow.yml` file.

  The workflow requires the following inputs:
  - `version`: The new version number
  - `title`: Title for the release
  - `changelog`: Description of changes
  - `issue`: ID of the originating issue

  <Warning>Remember to create a new tag for the new deployed version.</Warning>
  
  ```yml
  name: Task - Release

  on:
    workflow_dispatch:
      inputs:
        version:
          description: 'Release version'
          required: true
          default: '1.0.0'
        title:
          description: 'Title'
          required: true
          default: 'New Version'
        changelog:
          description: 'Changelog'
          required: true
          default: '- Several improvements'
        issue:
          description: 'Launcher issue'
          required: true
          default: '-1'

      name: Git Board - Issue
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Checkout Repository
          uses: actions/checkout@v4

        // create a new tag version here

        // deploy logic here

        - name: Git Board - Deploy success notification

            single-action-issue: '${{ github.event.inputs.issue }}'

## Example

For a hotfix issue #123 fixing a critical login bug:

1. Hotfix branch created: `hotfix/1.2.4`
2. Bugfix branch created: `bugfix/123-fix-critical-login`
3. Fix implemented and tested on bugfix branch
4. PR merged into `hotfix/1.2.4`
5. Version 1.2.4 deployed to production
6. Changes merged to `master` and `develop`

## Label

All release issues are created with the `release-label`. The default label for creating a release-type issue is `release`. You can configure this label as follows:

```yml
jobs:
  git-board-issues:
    name: Git Board - Issue
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Git Board - Issue
        uses: ./
        with:
          release-label: release // [!code highlight]
```

## Naming

The default tree for creating release branches is `release`. You can configure this tree name as follows:

```yml
jobs:
  git-board-issues:
    name: Git Board - Issue
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Git Board - Issue
        uses: ./
        with:
          release-tree: release // [!code highlight]
```

Release branches follow this naming convention:

```
release/version
```

For example:
```
release/1.2.3
```

## Source

Release branches are created from the development branch, ensuring that all planned features and fixes are included in the release. You can configure the development branch name as shown below:

```yml
jobs:
  git-board-issues:
    name: Git Board - Issue
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Git Board - Issue
        uses: ./
        with:
          development-branch: development // [!code highlight]
```

## Images

You can configure custom images to be displayed in the comments of release issues. These images will be randomly selected and displayed when Git Board Flow performs actions on the issue.

To configure the images, provide a comma-separated list of image URLs in the `images-issue-release` input:

```yml
jobs:
  git-board-issues:
    name: Git Board - Issue
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Git Board - Issue
        uses: ./
        with:
          images-issue-release: url1, url2, url3 // [!code highlight]
```

## Template
You can use this template for release issues that helps capture all the necessary information. The template includes fields for:

- Release type selection (Major/Minor/Patch)
- Version number (automatic or custom)
- Changelog details
- Additional context

You can find this template in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/release.yml`. Below is an example of how the template looks when creating a new release issue:

```yml
name: 🚀 Release Issue
description: Request a new release for git-board-flow (only team members)
title: "<YOUR TITLE HERE>"
labels: ["release", "branched"]
body:
  - type: markdown
    attributes:
      value: |
        ### ⚠️ Disclaimer
        > **Only members of the git-board-flow team can create release issues.**
        > Any release issue created by someone outside the team will be closed automatically.
