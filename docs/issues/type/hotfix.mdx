Hotfix issues are used to track and resolve critical bugs that need immediate attention in the production environment. These issues help maintain the stability of the production codebase by addressing urgent problems that affect functionality.

## Label

All hotfix issues are created with the `hotfix-label`. The default label for creating a hotfix-type issue is `hotfix`. You can configure this label as follows:

```yml
jobs:
  git-board-issues:
    name: Git Board - Issue
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Git Board - Issue
        uses: ./
        with:
          hotfix-label: hotfix // [!code highlight]
```

## Naming

The default tree for creating hotfix branches is `hotfix`. You can configure this tree name as follows:

```yml
jobs:
  git-board-issues:
    name: Git Board - Issue
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Git Board - Issue
        uses: ./
        with:
          hotfix-tree: hotfix // [!code highlight]
```

Hotfix branches follow this naming convention:

```
hotfix/NUM-ISSUE-issue-name
```

For example:
```
hotfix/123-fix-critical-login-issue
```

## Source

Hotfix branches are created from the master branch, specifically from the latest published tag. This ensures that hotfixes are based on the most recent stable production code. You can configure the master branch name as shown below:

```yml
jobs:
  git-board-issues:
    name: Git Board - Issue
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Git Board - Issue
        uses: ./
        with:
          main-branch: master // [!code highlight]
```

## Images

You can configure custom images to be displayed in the comments of hotfix issues. These images will be randomly selected and displayed when Git Board Flow performs actions on the issue.

To configure the images, provide a comma-separated list of image URLs in the `images-issue-hotfix` input:

```yml
jobs:
  git-board-issues:
    name: Git Board - Issue
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Git Board - Issue
        uses: ./
        with:
          images-issue-hotfix: url1, url2, url3 // [!code highlight]
```

## Template
You can use this template for hotfix issues that helps capture all the necessary information. The template includes fields for:

- Base version selection
- Hotfix version specification 
- Detailed issue description
- Proposed hotfix solution
- Additional context and comments

You can find this template in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/hotfix.yml`. Below is an example of how the template looks when creating a new hotfix issue:

```yml
name: 🔥 Hotfix Issue

description: Request a new hotfix for git-board-flow (only team members)
title: "<YOUR TITLE HERE>"
labels: [ "hotfix", "branched" ]
body:
  - type: markdown
    attributes:
      value: |
        ### ⚠️ Disclaimer
        > **Only members of the git-board-flow team can create hotfix issues.**
        > Any hotfix issue created by someone outside the team will be closed automatically.

        ---

  - type: input
    id: base_version
    attributes:
      label: Base Version
      description: |
        The base version is typically the most recent tag version. However, you can specify a different version tag if you'd like to start from a specific version for this hotfix.
      placeholder: "e.g., 1.2.3"
      value: "Automatic"
    validations:
      required: false

  - type: input
    id: hotfix_version
    attributes:
      label: Hotfix Version
      description: |
        By default, the version will increment the patch number of the most recent tag version (e.g., from 1.2.3 to 1.2.4). You can specify a different version number for the hotfix if needed.
      placeholder: "e.g., 1.2.4"
      value: "Automatic"
    validations:
      required: false

  - type: textarea
    id: issue_description
    attributes:
      label: Issue Description
      description: |
        Provide a detailed description of the issue this hotfix is addressing.
      placeholder: "Describe the issue being fixed."
    validations:
      required: true

  - type: textarea
    id: hotfix_solution
    attributes:
      label: Hotfix Solution
      description: |
        Explain the solution being implemented in this hotfix.
      placeholder: "Describe the solution."
    validations:
      required: true

  - type: textarea
    id: additional_context
    attributes:
      label: Additional Context
      description: |
        Add any additional details or context about this hotfix request.
      placeholder: "Anything else to note?"
```

## Workflow

The hotfix process follows these steps after creating an issue with `hotfix` and `branched` labels:

1. A hotfix branch is created from `master` at the latest tag version
2. A bugfix branch is created from the hotfix branch to implement the fix
3. The needed changes are applied on the bugfix branch
4. The bugfix is merged back into the hotfix branch via Pull Request
5. A new version is deployed from the hotfix branch by adding the `deploy` label to the issue
6. After successful deployment, the hotfix branch is merged:
   - First into `master` with the new version tag
   - Then into `develop` to keep changes synchronized
7. The issue is automatically closed with the `deployed` label once the process completes

This workflow ensures that critical fixes reach production quickly while maintaining code quality and proper version control. The process is designed to minimize disruption while addressing urgent issues.

## Example

For a hotfix issue #123 fixing a critical login bug:

1. Hotfix branch created: `hotfix/1.2.4`
2. Bugfix branch created: `bugfix/123-fix-critical-login`
3. Fix implemented and tested on bugfix branch
4. PR merged into `hotfix/1.2.4`
5. Version 1.2.4 deployed to production
6. Changes merged to `master` and `develop`
