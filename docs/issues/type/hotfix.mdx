Hotfix issues are used to track and resolve critical bugs that need immediate attention in the production environment. These issues help maintain the stability of the production codebase by addressing urgent problems that affect functionality.

## Workflow

The hotfix process follows these steps after creating an issue with `hotfix` and `branched` labels:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Hotfix Branch">
    A hotfix branch is created from `main-branch` at the latest tag version
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Bugfix Branch">
    A bugfix branch is created from the hotfix branch to implement the fix
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implement Changes">
    The needed changes are applied on the bugfix branch
  </Step>
  <Step title="Merge Bugfix">
    The bugfix is merged back into the hotfix branch via Pull Request
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy New Version">
    A new version is deployed from the hotfix branch by adding the `deploy-label` to the issue
  </Step>
  <Step title="Merge Hotfix">
    After successful deployment, the hotfix branch is merged:
    - First into `main-branch` with the new version tag
    - Then into `development-branch` to keep changes synchronized
  </Step>
  <Step title="Close Issue">
    The issue is automatically closed with the `deployed-label` label once the process completes
  </Step>
</Steps>

This workflow ensures that critical fixes reach production quickly while maintaining code quality and proper version control. The process is designed to minimize disruption while addressing urgent issues.

<Warning>Deploy workflow files should be located in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository.</Warning>

<Card title="How do I trigger the hotfix deployment?" icon="code-branch">
  Once your bug fix is merged into the `hotfix` branch and ready for deployment, simply add the **deploy-label** to the issue. This will automatically trigger the hotfix deployment workflow.

  By default, the deployment is triggered with the `deploy` label and uses the `hotfix_workflow.yml` workflow file. You can customize these settings as shown below:
  
  ```yml
  jobs:
    git-board-issues:
      name: Git Board - Issue
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: vypdev/copilot@v2
          with:
            deploy-label: deploy // [!code highlight]
            hotfix-workflow: hotfix_workflow.yml // [!code highlight]
  ```
</Card>

<Card title="How do I control the end of the deployment?" icon="rocket">
  The hotfix deployment workflow is defined in the `hotfix_workflow.yml` file.

  The workflow requires the following inputs:
  - `version`: The new version number
  - `title`: Title for the release
  - `changelog`: Description of changes
  - `issue`: ID of the originating issue

  <Warning>Remember to create a new tag for the new deployed version.</Warning>
  
  ```yml
  name: Task - Hotfix

  on:
    workflow_dispatch:
      inputs:
        version:
          description: 'Hotfix version'
          required: true
          default: '1.0.0'
        title:
          description: 'Title'
          required: true
          default: 'New Version'
        changelog:
          description: 'Changelog'
          required: true
          default: '- Several improvements'
        issue:
          description: 'Launcher issue'
          required: true
          default: '-1'

  jobs:
    deploy:
      name: Git Board - Issue
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Checkout Repository
          uses: actions/checkout@v4

        // create a new tag version here

        // deploy logic here

        - name: Git Board - Deploy success notification
          uses: vypdev/copilot@v2
          if: ${{ success() }}
          with:
            single-action: 'deployed_action'
            single-action-issue: '${{ github.event.inputs.issue }}'
            token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}

## Example

For a hotfix issue #123 fixing a critical login bug:

1. Hotfix branch created: `hotfix/1.2.4`
2. Bugfix branch created: `bugfix/123-fix-critical-login`
3. Fix implemented and tested on bugfix branch
4. PR merged into `hotfix/1.2.4`
5. Version 1.2.4 deployed to production
6. Changes merged to `master` and `develop`

## Label

All hotfix issues are created with the `hotfix-label`. The default label for creating a hotfix-type issue is `hotfix`. You can configure this label as follows:

```yml
jobs:
  git-board-issues:
    name: Git Board - Issue
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: vypdev/copilot@v2
        with:
          hotfix-label: hotfix // [!code highlight]
```

## Naming

The default tree for creating hotfix branches is `hotfix`. You can configure this tree name as follows:

```yml
jobs:
  git-board-issues:
    name: Git Board - Issue
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: vypdev/copilot@v2
        with:
          hotfix-tree: hotfix // [!code highlight]
```

Hotfix branches follow this naming convention:

```
hotfix/hotfix-version
```

For example:
```
hotfix/1.2.3
```

## Source

Hotfix branches are created from the master branch, specifically from the latest published tag. This ensures that hotfixes are based on the most recent stable production code. You can configure the master branch name as shown below:

```yml
jobs:
  git-board-issues:
    name: Git Board - Issue
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: vypdev/copilot@v2
        with:
          main-branch: master // [!code highlight]
```

## Images

You can configure custom images to be displayed in the comments of hotfix issues. These images will be randomly selected and displayed when Copilot performs actions on the issue.

To configure the images, provide a comma-separated list of image URLs in the `images-issue-hotfix` input:

```yml
jobs:
  git-board-issues:
    name: Git Board - Issue
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: vypdev/copilot@v2
        with:
          images-issue-hotfix: url1, url2, url3 // [!code highlight]
```

## Template
You can use this template for hotfix issues that helps capture all the necessary information. The template includes fields for:

- Base version selection
- Hotfix version specification 
- Detailed issue description
- Proposed hotfix solution
- Additional context and comments

You can find this template in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/hotfix.yml`. Below is an example of how the template looks when creating a new hotfix issue:

```yml
name: 🔥 Hotfix Issue

description: Request a new hotfix for copilot (only team members)

        ### ⚠️ Disclaimer
        > **Only members of the copilot team can create hotfix issues.**
        > Any hotfix issue created by someone outside the team will be closed automatically.
