# Notifications and auto-close

Copilot keeps the issue in sync with the branch: it **notifies** you of new commits and can **reopen** a closed issue when pushes happen. When the branch is **merged**, it can **automatically close** the issue. This page describes these behaviors and the inputs that control them.

## Commit notifications (real-time code tracking)

When the **push (commit)** workflow runs (on push to a branch linked to an issue), the action can **post a comment on the issue** with the new commit messages and links. That way, everyone following the issue sees progress in real time.

- **What is posted:** Commit summary (messages, authors, links to commits). Optionally **images** per branch type (feature, bugfix, etc.) if **`images-on-commit`** and the corresponding `images-commit-*` inputs are set. See [Configuration](/issues/configuration).
- **Where:** The comment is posted on the **issue** associated with the branch (the issue number is derived from the branch name, e.g. `feature/123-title` → issue `123`).

Commit notifications are part of the **Commit** workflow, not the Issue workflow. Ensure you have a workflow that runs on **push** (e.g. `copilot_commit.yml`) and that the Copilot step has `token` and any optional inputs (e.g. `project-ids`, `opencode-model` for progress/Bugbot). See [How to use](/how-to-use) and [Bugbot](/bugbot) for push-related features.

## Reopen issue on push

If an issue was **closed** but someone pushes again to its branch, you may want the issue to **reopen** so it’s not forgotten.

| Input | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **`reopen-issue-on-push`** | `true` | When the push workflow runs and the branch is linked to an issue that is **closed**, the action **reopens** that issue. Set to `false` to leave closed issues closed. |

This applies only when the **Commit** workflow runs (on push); the Issue workflow does not reopen issues by itself.

## Auto-close when branch is merged

When the **branch** created for the issue (e.g. `feature/123-title`) is **merged** (e.g. into `develop` or `main`), Copilot can **automatically close the issue**. You don’t have to remember to close it manually.

- **How it works:** The action listens for the merge (via the push/PR pipeline and branch state). When the branch no longer exists (merged and deleted) or the merge is detected, it closes the linked issue.
- **No extra input** is required for this behavior; it is part of the normal flow when the Commit and/or PR workflows run and the branch is merged.

## Summary

| Behavior | Controlled by | Where it runs |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| Commit notifications on issue | Commit workflow + optional images config | Push (Commit) workflow |
| Reopen closed issue on push | `reopen-issue-on-push` (default: true) | Push (Commit) workflow |
| Auto-close issue when branch merged | Built-in | Push / PR workflow when merge is detected |
