# Branch management

Copilot creates **branches** for issues when the right **labels** are present. For most issue types (feature, bugfix, docs, chore), a **launcher label** (e.g. `branched`) is required unless you set **`branch-management-always: true`**. For **hotfix** and **release**, the branch is created as soon as the type label is present (and the issue creator is a member). This page details the launcher, naming, and special rules.

## Launcher label (when to create the branch)

For **feature**, **bugfix**, **docs**, and **chore** issues, the action does **not** create a branch on issue open by default. A member must add a **launcher label** to trigger branch creation.

| Input | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **`branch-management-launcher-label`** | `branched` | Label that triggers branch creation when added to an issue that already has a type label (feature, bugfix, docs, chore). |
| **`branch-management-always`** | `false` | If `true`, the action **ignores** the launcher label: it creates the branch as soon as the issue has a type label (e.g. on open or when the type label is added). |

### Example: use the default launcher

Workflow:

```yaml
- uses: vypdev/copilot@v2
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
    branch-management-launcher-label: branched
```

Flow: Open issue with label `feature` → no branch yet. Add label `branched` → branch `feature/123-title` is created from `develop`.

### Example: create branch without launcher

```yaml
- uses: vypdev/copilot@v2
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
    branch-management-always: true
```

Flow: Open issue with label `feature` → branch is created immediately (no need to add `branched`).

## Naming conventions

Branch names follow **`<tree>/<issue-number>-<slug>`**. The **tree** is the prefix for the issue type; the **slug** is derived from the issue title (sanitized). You can configure main branch, development branch, and each tree.

| Input | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `main-branch` | `master` | Main production branch (used as base for hotfix). |
| `development-branch` | `develop` | Development branch (used as base for feature, bugfix, docs, chore, release). |
| `feature-tree` | `feature` | Prefix for feature branches. |
| `bugfix-tree` | `bugfix` | Prefix for bugfix branches. |
| `docs-tree` | `docs` | Prefix for docs branches. |
| `chore-tree` | `chore` | Prefix for chore branches. |
| `hotfix-tree` | `hotfix` | Prefix for hotfix branches. |
| `release-tree` | `release` | Prefix for release branches. |

### Example branch names

- `feature/123-add-user-login`
- `bugfix/456-fix-null-check`
- `hotfix/789-critical-payment-fix`
- `release/10-v1-2-0`

Use **`commit-prefix-transforms`** (e.g. `replace-slash`) so commit message prefixes match your conventions (e.g. `feature-123-add-user-login`). See [Configuration](/configuration).

### Example: custom naming

```yaml
- uses: vypdev/copilot@v2
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
    main-branch: main
    development-branch: dev
    feature-tree: feat
    bugfix-tree: fix
```

Branches would be e.g. `feat/123-add-login` and `fix/456-fix-bug`, created from `dev` (or `main` for hotfix).

## Hotfix and release: no launcher needed

For **hotfix** and **release**:

- The branch is created **without** requiring the launcher label. As soon as the issue has the `hotfix` or `release` label (and the creator is a member), the action creates the branch.
- **Hotfix** branches are created from **`main-branch`** (at the latest tag).
- **Release** branches are created from **`development-branch`**.
- If a **non-member** opens a hotfix or release issue, the action **closes** the issue to avoid accidental production/release flows.

Adding the **`deploy`** label to a release or hotfix issue **triggers** the workflow named in `release-workflow` or `hotfix-workflow`. Ensure those workflow **filenames** match exactly (e.g. `release_workflow.yml`, `hotfix_workflow.yml`). See [Labels and branch types](/issues/labels-and-branch-types).

## Emoji in issue title

When **`emoji-labeled-title`** is `true` (default), the action can update the issue title to include an emoji based on labels (e.g. 🧑‍💻 when branched). The **`branch-management-emoji`** input (default: 🧑‍💻) is the emoji used for branched issues. See [Configuration](/issues/configuration).
