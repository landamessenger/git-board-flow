# Single Actions

When you set the `single-action` input (and any required targets such as `single-action-issue` or `single-action-version`), Git Board Flow runs **only** that action and skips the normal issue, pull request, and push pipelines.

## Usage

In your workflow, pass the action name and any required inputs:

```yaml
- uses: landamessenger/git-board-flow@master
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
    single-action: check_progress_action
    single-action-issue: '123'
```

## Available single actions

| Action | Inputs | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `check_progress_action` | `single-action-issue` | Analyzes branch vs issue description via OpenCode and posts a progress percentage and summary on the issue. |
| `think_action` | — | Deep code analysis and change proposals (OpenCode). No issue required. |
| `ai_cache_action` | — | Vector indexing / AI cache update for the codebase. No issue required. |
| `ai_cache_local_action` | — | Same as `ai_cache_action` for local/self-hosted runners. No issue required. |
| `initial_setup` | — | Initial setup steps. No issue required. |
| `create_release` | `single-action-version`, `single-action-title`, `single-action-changelog` | Creates a GitHub release. |
| `create_tag` | `single-action-version` | Creates a Git tag. |
| `publish_github_action` | — | Publishes or updates the GitHub Action. |
| `deployed_action` | `single-action-issue` | Marks the issue as deployed; updates labels and project state. |

Actions that **fail the job** if the last step fails: `ai_cache_action`, `publish_github_action`, `create_release`, `deployed_action`, `create_tag`.
