# Single Actions

When you set the `single-action` input (and any required targets such as `single-action-issue` or `single-action-version`), Git Board Flow runs **only** that action and skips the normal issue, pull request, and push pipelines.

## Usage

In your workflow, pass the action name and any required inputs:

```yaml
- uses: landamessenger/git-board-flow@master
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
    single-action: check_progress_action
    single-action-issue: '123'
```

## Available single actions

| Action | Inputs | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `check_progress_action` | `single-action-issue` | Runs progress check on demand. Progress is normally updated automatically on every push (commit workflow); use this to re-run without pushing or when you don't use the push workflow. |
| `detect_errors_action` | `single-action-issue` | Detects potential errors in the branch vs base using OpenCode Plan agent. |
| `recommend_steps_action` | `single-action-issue` | Recommends implementation steps for the issue based on its description (OpenCode Plan). |
| `think_action` | — | Deep code analysis and change proposals (OpenCode Plan). No issue required; use from CLI with a question (`think -q "..."`) or from a workflow that provides context. |
| `initial_setup` | — | Initial setup steps. No issue required. |
| `create_release` | `single-action-version`, `single-action-title`, `single-action-changelog` | Creates a GitHub release. |
| `create_tag` | `single-action-version` | Creates a Git tag. |
| `publish_github_action` | — | Publishes or updates the GitHub Action. |
| `deployed_action` | `single-action-issue` | Marks the issue as deployed; updates labels and project state. |

Actions that **fail the job** if the last step fails: `publish_github_action`, `create_release`, `deployed_action`, `create_tag`.
