# Features & Capabilities

This page describes **every function** the Git Board Flow GitHub Action provides: workflow-triggered behavior (issues, pull requests, pushes) and **single actions** you can run on demand.

---

## Workflow-triggered behavior

The action is typically invoked by three workflow triggers. What it does depends on the event.

### 1. Issue events (`on: issues`)

When the workflow runs on `issues` (opened, edited, labeled, unlabeled, etc.):

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Branch creation** | Creates branches from the development branch (or main for hotfix/release) based on issue labels (feature, bugfix, docs, chore, hotfix, release). Optional: requires a launcher label (e.g. `branched`) unless `branch-management-always` is true. |
| **Branch–issue linking** | Links the new branch to the issue and adds a comment summarizing the actions taken. |
| **Project linking** | Adds the issue to the configured GitHub Projects (by `project-ids`) and moves it to the configured column (e.g. "Todo", "In Progress"). |
| **Assignees** | Assigns up to `desired-assignees-count` members to the issue (creator preferred if in org). |
| **Issue type** | Sets the GitHub issue type (Task, Bug, Feature, Documentation, etc.) from labels. |
| **Emoji titles** | Optionally adds emojis to issue titles based on labels (`emoji-labeled-title`). |
| **Size labels** | Assigns size labels (XS–XXL) and checks size thresholds (lines, files, commits) for prioritization. |
| **Comments & images** | Posts comments with optional images (per branch type: feature, bugfix, docs, chore, hotfix, release). |
| **Smart workflow guidance** | Comments can include Git-Flow reminders and next steps. |

### 2. Pull request events (`on: pull_request`)

When the workflow runs on `pull_request` (opened, edited, etc.):

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **PR–issue linking** | Links the pull request to the issue associated with its branch and posts a comment. |
| **Project linking** | Adds the PR to the configured GitHub Projects and moves it to the configured column. |
| **Reviewers** | Assigns up to `desired-reviewers-count` reviewers. |
| **Priority & size** | Applies priority and size checks (labels and thresholds). |
| **AI PR description** | If `ai-pull-request-description` is true and OpenCode is configured, can generate or update the PR description from the issue and diff. |
| **Comments & images** | Posts comments with optional images per branch type. |

### 3. Push events (`on: push`)

When the workflow runs on `push` (e.g. to any branch):

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Commit notifications** | For branches linked to an issue, posts a comment on the issue with commit messages and links. |
| **Commit prefix check** | Warns if commit messages do not follow the prefix derived from the branch name (using `commit-prefix-transforms`). |
| **Reopen issue** | If `reopen-issue-on-push` is true, reopens the issue when new commits are pushed to its branch. |
| **Comments & images** | Posts commit summary comments with optional images. |

---

## Single actions

When you set `single-action` (and, when required, `single-action-issue`, `single-action-version`, `single-action-title`, `single-action-changelog`), the action runs **only** that action and skips the normal issue/PR/push pipelines.

| Single action value | Inputs required | Description |
|--------------------|----------------|-------------|
| **`check_progress_action`** | `single-action-issue` | Uses OpenCode to analyze the branch diff vs the issue description and posts a **progress percentage** (e.g. "Progress: 30%") and summary as a comment on the issue. |
| **`think_action`** | — | Uses OpenCode for deep code analysis and change proposals (reasoning over the codebase). No issue required. |
| **`initial_setup`** | — | Performs initial setup steps (e.g. for repo or project). No issue required. |
| **`create_release`** | `single-action-version`, `single-action-title`, `single-action-changelog` | Creates a GitHub release with the given version, title, and changelog. |
| **`create_tag`** | `single-action-version` | Creates a Git tag for the given version. |
| **`publish_github_action`** | — | Publishes or updates the GitHub Action (e.g. versioning, release). |
| **`deployed_action`** | `single-action-issue` | Marks the issue as deployed; updates labels and project state (e.g. "deployed"). |

Single actions that **throw an error** if the last step fails: `publish_github_action`, `create_release`, `deployed_action`, `create_tag`. This lets the workflow fail the job when the action does not succeed.

## AI features (OpenCode)

All AI features go through **OpenCode** (one server URL + model). You can use 75+ providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama, etc.) by configuring OpenCode.

| Feature | Where it runs | Description |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| **Check progress** | Single action `check_progress_action` | ProgressDetector agent compares issue description vs branch diff and reports a percentage and summary. |
| **Think / reasoning** | Single action `think_action` | Deep code analysis and change proposals. |
| **AI PR description** | Pull request pipeline | Generates or updates PR description from issue and diff. |
| **Copilot** | Used internally by other flows | Code analysis and manipulation agent. |
| **Error detection** | Can be used in analysis flows | Detects potential bugs and issues in the codebase. |

Configuration: `opencode-server-url`, `opencode-model`, and optionally `opencode-start-server` (action starts and stops OpenCode in the job). See [OpenCode (AI)](/opencode-integration).

---

## Other capabilities

- **Commit prefix transforms**: `commit-prefix-transforms` defines how branch names are turned into commit prefixes (e.g. `replace-slash`, `kebab-case`). Used for validation and comments.
- **Issue types**: Configurable issue type names, descriptions, and colors (Task, Bug, Feature, Documentation, Maintenance, Hotfix, Release, Question, Help).
- **Debug**: Set `debug: true` for verbose logging.

For full input reference, see [Configuration](/configuration).
