# Features & Capabilities

This page describes **every function** the Git Board Flow GitHub Action provides: workflow-triggered behavior (issues, pull requests, pushes) and **single actions** you can run on demand.

---

## Workflow-triggered behavior

The action is typically invoked by three workflow triggers. What it does depends on the event.

### 1. Issue events (`on: issues`)

When the workflow runs on `issues` (opened, edited, labeled, unlabeled, etc.):

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Branch creation** | Creates branches from the development branch (or main for hotfix/release) based on issue labels (feature, bugfix, docs, chore, hotfix, release). Optional: requires a launcher label (e.g. `branched`) unless `branch-management-always` is true. |
| **Branch–issue linking** | Links the new branch to the issue and adds a comment summarizing the actions taken. |
| **Project linking** | Adds the issue to the configured GitHub Projects (by `project-ids`) and moves it to the configured column (e.g. "Todo", "In Progress"). |
| **Assignees** | Assigns up to `desired-assignees-count` members to the issue (creator preferred if in org). |
| **Issue type** | Sets the GitHub issue type (Task, Bug, Feature, Documentation, etc.) from labels. |
| **Emoji titles** | Optionally adds emojis to issue titles based on labels (`emoji-labeled-title`). |
| **Size labels** | Assigns size labels (XS–XXL) and checks size thresholds (lines, files, commits) for prioritization. |
| **Comments & images** | Posts comments with optional images (per branch type: feature, bugfix, docs, chore, hotfix, release). |
| **Smart workflow guidance** | Comments can include Git-Flow reminders and next steps. |

### 2. Pull request events (`on: pull_request`)

When the workflow runs on `pull_request` (opened, edited, etc.):

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **PR–issue linking** | Links the pull request to the issue associated with its branch and posts a comment. |
| **Project linking** | Adds the PR to the configured GitHub Projects and moves it to the configured column. |
| **Reviewers** | Assigns up to `desired-reviewers-count` reviewers. |
| **Priority & size** | Applies priority and size checks (labels and thresholds). |
| **AI PR description** | If `ai-pull-request-description` is true and OpenCode is configured, generates or updates the PR description by filling the repo's `.github/pull_request_template.md` from the issue and the branch diff (OpenCode Plan agent). See [Pull Requests → AI-generated PR description](/pull-requests#ai-generated-pr-description). |
| **Comments & images** | Posts comments with optional images per branch type. |

### 3. Push events (`on: push`)

When the workflow runs on `push` (e.g. to any branch):

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Commit notifications** | For branches linked to an issue, posts a comment on the issue with commit messages and links. |
| **Commit prefix check** | Warns if commit messages do not follow the prefix derived from the branch name (using `commit-prefix-transforms`). |
| **Reopen issue** | If `reopen-issue-on-push` is true, reopens the issue when new commits are pushed to its branch. |
| **Size & progress** | Computes size (XS–XXL) and progress (0–100%) from the branch diff; updates the **issue** and any **open PRs** for that branch with the same labels. Requires OpenCode for progress. No separate workflow is needed. |
| **Comments & images** | Posts commit summary comments with optional images. |

---

## Single actions

When you set `single-action` (and, when required, `single-action-issue`, `single-action-version`, `single-action-title`, `single-action-changelog`), the action runs **only** that action and skips the normal issue/PR/push pipelines.

| Single action value | Inputs required | Description |
|--------------------|----------------|-------------|
| **`check_progress_action`** | `single-action-issue` | Runs progress check on demand (e.g. without pushing). Progress is normally updated automatically on every push; use this to re-run the check or when no push workflow is configured. |
| **`detect_errors_action`** | `single-action-issue` | Uses OpenCode Plan to detect potential errors in the branch vs base; posts a comment on the issue. |
| **`recommend_steps_action`** | `single-action-issue` | Uses OpenCode Plan to recommend implementation steps from the issue description; posts a comment on the issue. |
| **`think_action`** | — | Uses OpenCode Plan for deep code analysis and change proposals (reasoning over the codebase). No issue required. |
| **`initial_setup`** | — | Performs initial setup steps (e.g. for repo or project). No issue required. |
| **`create_release`** | `single-action-version`, `single-action-title`, `single-action-changelog` | Creates a GitHub release with the given version, title, and changelog. |
| **`create_tag`** | `single-action-version` | Creates a Git tag for the given version. |
| **`publish_github_action`** | — | Publishes or updates the GitHub Action (e.g. versioning, release). |
| **`deployed_action`** | `single-action-issue` | Marks the issue as deployed; updates labels and project state (e.g. "deployed"). |

Single actions that **throw an error** if the last step fails: `publish_github_action`, `create_release`, `deployed_action`, `create_tag`. This lets the workflow fail the job when the action does not succeed.

## AI features (OpenCode)

All AI features go through **OpenCode** (one server URL + model). You can use 75+ providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama, etc.) by configuring OpenCode.

| Feature | Where it runs | Description |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| **Check progress** | Push (commit) pipeline; optional single action `check_progress_action` / CLI `check-progress` | On every push, OpenCode Plan compares issue vs branch diff and updates the progress label on the issue and on any open PRs for that branch. You can also run it on demand via single action or CLI. |
| **Think / reasoning** | Single action `think_action` | Deep code analysis and change proposals (OpenCode Plan agent). |
| **AI PR description** | Pull request pipeline | Fills the repo's `.github/pull_request_template.md` from issue and branch diff (OpenCode Plan agent). |
| **Copilot** | CLI `giik copilot` | Code analysis and file edits via OpenCode Build agent. |
| **Error detection** | Single action / CLI | Detects potential bugs and issues in the codebase (OpenCode Plan agent). |
| **Recommend steps** | Single action / CLI | Suggests implementation steps from the issue description (OpenCode Plan agent). |

Configuration: `opencode-server-url`, `opencode-model`, and optionally `opencode-start-server` (action starts and stops OpenCode in the job). See [OpenCode (AI)](/opencode-integration).

## Other capabilities

- **Commit prefix transforms**: `commit-prefix-transforms` defines how branch names are turned into commit prefixes (e.g. `replace-slash`, `kebab-case`). Used for validation and comments.
- **Issue types**: Configurable issue type names, descriptions, and colors (Task, Bug, Feature, Documentation, Maintenance, Hotfix, Release, Question, Help).
- **Debug**: Set `debug: true` for verbose logging.

For full input reference, see [Configuration](/configuration).
