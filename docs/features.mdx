## Workflow-triggered behavior

The action is typically invoked by three workflow triggers. What it does depends on the event.

### 1. Issue events (`on: issues`)

When the workflow runs on `issues` (opened, edited, labeled, unlabeled, etc.):

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Branch creation** | Creates branches from the development branch (or main for hotfix/release) based on issue labels (feature, bugfix, docs, chore, hotfix, release). Optional: requires a launcher label (e.g. `branched`) unless `branch-management-always` is true. |
| **Branch–issue linking** | Links the new branch to the issue and adds a comment summarizing the actions taken. |
| **Project linking** | Adds the issue to the configured GitHub Projects (by `project-ids`) and moves it to the configured column (e.g. "Todo", "In Progress"). |
| **Assignees** | Assigns up to `desired-assignees-count` members to the issue (creator preferred if in org). |
| **Issue type** | Sets the GitHub issue type (Task, Bug, Feature, Documentation, etc.) from labels. |
| **Emoji titles** | Optionally adds emojis to issue titles based on labels (`emoji-labeled-title`). |
| **Size labels** | Assigns size labels (XS–XXL) and checks size thresholds (lines, files, commits) for prioritization. |
| **Comments & images** | Posts comments with optional images (per branch type: feature, bugfix, docs, chore, hotfix, release). |
| **Smart workflow guidance** | Comments can include Git-Flow reminders and next steps. |

### 2. Pull request events (`on: pull_request`)

When the workflow runs on `pull_request` (opened, edited, etc.):

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **PR–issue linking** | Links the pull request to the issue associated with its branch and posts a comment. |
| **Project linking** | Adds the PR to the configured GitHub Projects and moves it to the configured column. |
| **Reviewers** | Assigns up to `desired-reviewers-count` reviewers. |
| **Priority & size** | Applies priority and size checks (labels and thresholds). |
| **AI PR description** | If `ai-pull-request-description` is true and OpenCode is configured, generates or updates the PR description by filling the repo's `.github/pull_request_template.md` from the issue and the branch diff (OpenCode Plan agent). See [Pull Requests → AI-generated PR description](/pull-requests/ai-description). |
| **Comments & images** | Posts comments with optional images per branch type. |

### 3. Push events (`on: push`)

When the workflow runs on `push` (e.g. to any branch):

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Commit notifications** | For branches linked to an issue, posts a comment on the issue with commit messages and links. |
| **Commit prefix check** | Warns if commit messages do not follow the prefix derived from the branch name (using `commit-prefix-transforms`). |
| **Reopen issue** | If `reopen-issue-on-push` is true, reopens the issue when new commits are pushed to its branch. |
| **Size & progress** | Computes size (XS–XXL) and progress (0–100%) from the branch diff; updates the **issue** and any **open PRs** for that branch with the same labels. Requires OpenCode for progress. No separate workflow is needed. |
| **Bugbot (potential problems)** | OpenCode analyzes the branch vs base and reports findings as **comments on the issue** and **review comments on open PRs**; updates issue comments when findings are resolved and **marks PR review threads as resolved** when applicable. Configurable via `bugbot-severity` and `ai-ignore-files`. See [Issues](/issues#bugbot-potential-problems) and [Pull Requests](/pull-requests#bugbot-potential-problems). |
| **Comments & images** | Posts commit summary comments with optional images. |

---

## Single actions

When you set `single-action` (and, when required, `single-action-issue`, `single-action-version`, `single-action-title`, `single-action-changelog`), the action runs **only** that action and skips the normal issue/PR/push pipelines.

| Single action value | Inputs required | Description |
|--------------------|----------------|-------------|
| **`check_progress_action`** | `single-action-issue` | Runs progress check on demand (e.g. without pushing). Progress is normally updated automatically on every push; use this to re-run the check or when no push workflow is configured. |
| **`detect_potential_problems_action`** | `single-action-issue` | Bugbot: OpenCode analyzes the branch vs base; reports findings as comments on the issue and as PR review comments; updates issue comments and marks PR review threads as resolved when findings are fixed. |
| **`recommend_steps_action`** | `single-action-issue` | Uses OpenCode Plan to recommend implementation steps from the issue description; posts a comment on the issue. |
| **`think_action`** | — | Uses OpenCode Plan for deep code analysis and change proposals (reasoning over the codebase). No issue required. |
| **`initial_setup`** | — | Performs initial setup steps (e.g. for repo or project). No issue required. |
| **`create_release`** | `single-action-version`, `single-action-title`, `single-action-changelog` | Creates a GitHub release with the given version, title, and changelog. |
| **`create_tag`** | `single-action-version` | Creates a Git tag for the given version. |
| **`publish_github_action`** | — | Publishes or updates the GitHub Action (e.g. versioning, release). |
| **`deployed_action`** | `single-action-issue` | Marks the issue as deployed; updates labels and project state (e.g. "deployed"). |

Single actions that **throw an error** if the last step fails: `publish_github_action`, `create_release`, `deployed_action`, `create_tag`. This lets the workflow fail the job when the action does not succeed.

---

## AI features (OpenCode)

All AI features go through **OpenCode** (one server URL + model). You can use 75+ providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama, etc.) by configuring OpenCode.

| Feature | Where it runs | Description |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| **Check progress** | Push (commit) pipeline; optional single action `check_progress_action` / CLI `check-progress` | On every push, OpenCode Plan compares issue vs branch diff and updates the progress label on the issue and on any open PRs for that branch. You can also run it on demand via single action or CLI. |
| **Bugbot (potential problems)** | Push (commit) pipeline; optional single action `detect_potential_problems_action` / CLI `detect-potential-problems` | Analyzes branch vs base and posts findings as **comments on the issue** and **review comments on open PRs**; updates issue comments and marks PR review threads as resolved when findings are fixed. Configurable: `bugbot-severity`, `ai-ignore-files`. |
| **Think / reasoning** | Issue/PR comment pipeline; single action `think_action` | Deep code analysis and change proposals (OpenCode Plan agent). On comments: answers when mentioned (or on any comment for question/help issues). |
| **Comment translation** | Issue comment; PR review comment | Translates comments to the configured locale (`issues-locale`, `pull-requests-locale`) when they are written in another language. |
| **AI PR description** | Pull request pipeline | Fills the repo's `.github/pull_request_template.md` from issue and branch diff (OpenCode Plan agent). |
| **Copilot** | CLI `giik copilot` | Code analysis and file edits via OpenCode Build agent. |
| **Recommend steps** | Single action / CLI | Suggests implementation steps from the issue description (OpenCode Plan agent). |

Configuration: `opencode-server-url`, `opencode-model`, and optionally `opencode-start-server` (action starts and stops OpenCode in the job). See [OpenCode (AI)](/opencode-integration).

## Workflow concurrency and sequential execution

<Tip>
  **Sequential runs:** When a new run starts, the action **waits** for any previous run of the **same workflow name** to finish. Runs of the same workflow (e.g. "Git Board Flow - Issue") execute one after another instead of in parallel or being cancelled — something GitHub does not offer natively.
</Tip>

GitHub's native [concurrency](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#concurrency) lets you cancel in-progress runs when a new one starts (`cancel-in-progress: true`). Git Board Flow adds **sequential execution** for the same workflow: when a new run starts, the action waits for any previous run of the same workflow name to finish before doing its work.

### How it works

1. At the start of each run (except welcome/single-action-only flows), the action calls the GitHub API to list workflow runs for the repo.
2. It filters runs that have the **same workflow name** as the current run, a **lower run ID** (i.e. started earlier), and status `in_progress` or `queued`.
3. If any such run exists, the action waits 2 seconds and checks again, up to a long timeout (~4000 seconds).
4. When no previous run of the same workflow is active, the action continues.

So you get a **per-workflow queue**: multiple triggers for the same workflow (e.g. many issues labeled at once) will run sequentially.

### Example

```yaml
name: Git Board Flow - Issue

on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, edited, labeled, unlabeled]

jobs:
  git-board-flow-issues:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: landamessenger/git-board-flow@master
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.PAT }}
          project-ids: '2,3'
```

If you prefer to cancel the previous run when a new one is triggered (e.g. for PRs, so only the latest run matters), use `cancel-in-progress: true` and the same `concurrency.group` per PR or issue.

## Other capabilities

- **Commit prefix transforms**: `commit-prefix-transforms` defines how branch names are turned into commit prefixes (e.g. `replace-slash`, `kebab-case`). Used for validation and comments.
- **Issue types**: Configurable issue type names, descriptions, and colors (Task, Bug, Feature, Documentation, Maintenance, Hotfix, Release, Question, Help).
- **Debug**: Set `debug: true` for verbose logging.

For full input reference, see [Configuration](/configuration).
