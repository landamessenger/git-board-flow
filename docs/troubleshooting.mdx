# Troubleshooting

This guide helps you resolve common issues you might encounter while using Git Board Flow.

## Branch Creation Issues

### Branch Creation Fails

**Symptoms:**
- Error messages during branch creation
- Branches not being created automatically
- Permission denied errors

**Solutions:**
1. Verify token permissions:
   - Ensure the `token` (PAT) has repo and project access
   - Check token scope and validity

2. Check label configuration:
   - Confirm labels exist in repository
   - Verify label names match configuration
   - Check label triggers are working

3. Validate branch names:
   - Ensure branch names are valid
   - Check for naming conflicts
   - Verify branch prefix configuration

## Project Integration Issues

### Project Linking Problems

**Symptoms:**
- Issues not appearing in projects
- PRs not being linked automatically
- Project automation not working

**Solutions:**
1. Verify project configuration:
   - Use `project-ids` (comma-separated project IDs), not URLs
   - Ensure projects exist and the token has access
   - Verify organization project permissions if applicable

2. Check token scope:
   - Confirm project access permissions
   - Verify organization access if needed
   - Check token expiration

3. Project visibility:
   - Check project visibility settings
   - Verify organization permissions
   - Ensure user has project access

## Workflow Timeouts

### Workflow Execution Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Workflows timing out
- Long execution times
- Failed workflow runs

**Solutions:**
1. Adjust timeout settings:
   - Increase `merge-timeout` if needed
   - Check workflow step timeouts
   - Monitor execution times

2. Network connectivity:
   - Check GitHub API status
   - Verify network access
   - Monitor rate limits

3. Workflow triggers:
   - Verify event triggers
   - Check workflow conditions
   - Monitor concurrent executions

## Action skips issue/PR/push pipelines

**Symptoms:**
- The workflow runs but nothing happens (no branches created, no project linking, no comments).
- Logs say something like "User from token (...) matches actor. Ignoring."

**Cause:** When the **event actor** (the user who triggered the event: e.g. who opened the issue, who pushed, who opened the PR) is the **same** as the user who owns the PAT (`token`), the action intentionally skips the normal issue, PR, and push pipelines. It will only run a **single action** if you passed `single-action`; otherwise it exits without doing anything.

**Solutions:**
1. Use a **dedicated bot account** for the PAT (e.g. `giik-bot`) so that the actor (developer) is different from the token user. Then the full pipelines run as expected.
2. If you want to run only specific actions when you are the actor, use `single-action` (e.g. `check_progress_action`, `deployed_action`) so the action runs that single action and exits.

See [Authentication](/authentication) for token setup and the note on token user vs. actor.

## Common Error Messages

### Understanding and Fixing Errors

1. "Permission Denied"
   - Check token permissions
   - Verify repository access
   - Review security settings

2. "Resource Not Found"
   - Verify resource exists
   - Check access permissions
   - Validate URLs and paths

3. "Invalid Configuration"
   - Review workflow syntax
   - Check configuration values
   - Validate input parameters

## OpenCode (AI) issues

- **"Missing required AI configuration"**: Set `opencode-server-url` and `opencode-model` (or use `opencode-start-server: true` and pass provider API keys as secrets). See [OpenCode (AI)](/opencode-integration).
- **Connection errors**: Ensure the OpenCode server is reachable from the runner (URL, port, network/firewall). If using `opencode-start-server: true`, check that the job has network access to download `opencode-ai` and that API keys are set.
- **Invalid JSON response**: If the AI returns malformed JSON (e.g. for progress/error detection), the model may not follow the schema. Try a different model or check the OpenCode logs.

## CLI issues

- **"Git repository not found"**: Ensure you're in a directory with `git` initialized and `remote.origin.url` pointing to a GitHub repository (e.g. `github.com/owner/repo`).
- **"Please provide a prompt using -p or --prompt"**: The `copilot` command requires a prompt. Use `-p "your prompt"` or `--prompt "your prompt"`.
- **"Please provide an issue number using -i or --issue"**: Commands like `check-progress`, `detect-errors`, and `recommend-steps` require an issue number with `-i <number>`.
