# Troubleshooting

This guide helps you resolve common issues you might encounter while using Git Board Flow.

## Branch Creation Issues

### Branch Creation Fails

**Symptoms:**
- Error messages during branch creation
- Branches not being created automatically
- Permission denied errors

**Solutions:**
1. Verify token permissions:
   - Ensure the `token` (PAT) has repo and project access
   - Check token scope and validity

2. Check label configuration:
   - Confirm labels exist in repository
   - Verify label names match configuration
   - Check label triggers are working

3. Validate branch names:
   - Ensure branch names are valid
   - Check for naming conflicts
   - Verify branch prefix configuration

## Project Integration Issues

### Project Linking Problems

**Symptoms:**
- Issues not appearing in projects
- PRs not being linked automatically
- Project automation not working

**Solutions:**
1. Verify project configuration:
   - Use `project-ids` (comma-separated project IDs), not URLs
   - Ensure projects exist and the token has access
   - Verify organization project permissions if applicable

2. Check token scope:
   - Confirm project access permissions
   - Verify organization access if needed
   - Check token expiration

3. Project visibility:
   - Check project visibility settings
   - Verify organization permissions
   - Ensure user has project access

## Workflow Timeouts

### Workflow Execution Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Workflows timing out
- Long execution times
- Failed workflow runs

**Solutions:**
1. Adjust timeout settings:
   - Increase `merge-timeout` if needed
   - Check workflow step timeouts
   - Monitor execution times

2. Network connectivity:
   - Check GitHub API status
   - Verify network access
   - Monitor rate limits

3. Workflow triggers:
   - Verify event triggers
   - Check workflow conditions
   - Monitor concurrent executions

## Common Error Messages

### Understanding and Fixing Errors

1. "Permission Denied"
   - Check token permissions
   - Verify repository access
   - Review security settings

2. "Resource Not Found"
   - Verify resource exists
   - Check access permissions
   - Validate URLs and paths

3. "Invalid Configuration"
   - Review workflow syntax
   - Check configuration values
   - Validate input parameters

## OpenCode (AI) issues

- **"Missing required AI configuration"**: Set `opencode-server-url` and `opencode-model` (or use `opencode-start-server: true` and pass provider API keys as secrets). See [OpenCode (AI)](/opencode-integration).
- **Connection errors**: Ensure the OpenCode server is reachable from the runner (URL, port, network/firewall). If using `opencode-start-server: true`, check that the job has network access to download `opencode-ai` and that API keys are set.
