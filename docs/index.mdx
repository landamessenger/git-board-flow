> This is Github with super powers 🚀

**Git Board Flow** is designed with task management in mind, closely mirroring the approach used by Atlassian with Bitbucket and Jira. It leverages GitHub's project boards and issues as the foundation for task management at every stage of development.

The goal is to replicate the seamless integration of boards, tasks, and branches that Atlassian offers, enhancing your workflow and project management capabilities.

This repository itself utilizes this GitHub Action for task management. You can explore the various issues and pull requests as examples of how it functions in practice.

Experience seamless project management, automated branch handling, and enhanced team collaboration. Start optimizing your development process today and take your Git workflow to the next level! ✨

## Motivation

I've always felt that while GitHub is an outstanding platform for code management, its issue tracking and project boards — despite their powerful capabilities — are often underused or overlooked. Many teams and individual developers tend to focus primarily on version control and pull requests, missing out on the full potential of these features for organizing and streamlining their workflows.

This project was created with both large organizations and small teams in mind, as well as for individual developers who enjoy building their ideas as a hobby. Whether you're managing a complex project or just keeping track of your personal coding adventures, this GitHub Action aims to help you make the most of the tools GitHub already offers, enhancing productivity and bringing more structure to your development process.

For a complete list of what the action does (workflow triggers and single actions), see [Features & Capabilities](/features).

## Features

### Issue Management
- Automatic branch creation based on issue labels
- Real-time issue status updates
- Automated issue tracking and monitoring
- Seamless integration with GitHub Projects
- Issue assignment and label management
- **Bugbot**: AI-reported potential problems as comments on the issue, updated when findings are resolved

### Pull Request Features
- Automatic PR linking to issues
- Branch status tracking
- PR review process automation
- Commit monitoring and updates
- **Bugbot**: Potential problems as PR review comments, with threads marked as resolved when fixed
- Efficient PR lifecycle management

### Project Integration
- Automated project board updates
- Task status synchronization
- Column movement automation
- Project progress tracking
- Team workflow optimization

### Performance
- Fast execution
- **Sequential workflow handling** — The action waits for previous runs of the same workflow to finish, so you can avoid cancellations and run workflows one after another (see [Features → Workflow concurrency](/features#workflow-concurrency-and-sequential-execution)).
- Efficient resource utilization
- Reliable automation
