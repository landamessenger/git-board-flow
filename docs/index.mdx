**Git Board Flow** is designed with task management in mind, closely mirroring the approach used by Atlassian with Bitbucket and Jira. It leverages GitHub's project boards and issues as the foundation for task management at every stage of development.

The goal is to replicate the seamless integration of boards, tasks, and branches that Atlassian offers, enhancing your workflow and project management capabilities.

This repository itself utilizes this GitHub Action for task management. You can explore the various issues and pull requests as examples of how it functions in practice.

Experience seamless project management, automated branch handling, and enhanced team collaboration. Start optimizing your development process today and take your Git workflow to the next level! âœ¨
