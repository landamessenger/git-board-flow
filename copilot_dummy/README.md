# Copilot Dummy Directory

This directory is used as a playground for the Copilot agent.

The Copilot agent will use this directory for:
- Creating test files
- Modifying files for experimentation
- Testing code changes before applying them to the main codebase

You can safely create, modify, and delete files in this directory without affecting the main codebase.
