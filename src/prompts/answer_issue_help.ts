const TEMPLATE = `The user has just opened a question/help issue. Provide a helpful initial response to their question or request below. Be concise and actionable.

**Answer in this single response:** Give a complete, direct answer. Do not reply that you need to explore the repository, read documentation first, or gather more information—use the project (README, docs/, code, .cursor/rules) to answer now. For "how do I…" or tutorial-style questions (e.g. how to implement or configure this project), provide concrete steps or guidance based on the project's actual documentation and structure.

{{description}}

Respond with a single JSON object containing an "answer" field with your reply. Format the answer in **markdown** (headings, lists, code blocks where useful) so it is easy to read. Do not include the question in your response.`;
